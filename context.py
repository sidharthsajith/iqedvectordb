## 1.Consecutive 10 Numbers Addition Trick

This trick provides a shortcut for adding 10 consecutive numbers.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the first number:** Take the first number in the series of 10 consecutive numbers.
    *   Example 1: For the series $23+24+25+26+27+28+29+30+31+32$, the first number is 23.
    *   Example 2: For the series $76+77+78+79+80+81+82+83+84+85$, the first number is 76.
    *   Example 3: For the series $146+147+148+149+150+151+152+153+154+155$, the first number is 146.

## - **2.Addition splitting method** 
The video demonstrates the "Addition: Number Splitting Method," a technique to simplify adding large numbers by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts based on place value. This method is particularly useful for mental calculations and can enhance arithmetic speed.

**How it works:**

1.  **Split the Numbers by Place Value:** Decompose each number in the addition problem into its individual place values (tens, ones; or hundreds, tens, ones, etc.).
2.  **Add Corresponding Place Values:** Group and add the numbers belonging to the same place value.
3.  **Combine the Sums:** Add the results from step 2 to get the final sum.

**Example 1 (from video 0:25):**
Problem: 2457 + 1321

*   **Split:**
    *   2457 becomes 24 (hundreds/thousands) and 57 (tens/ones)
    *   1321 becomes 13 (hundreds/thousands) and 21 (tens/ones)
*   **Add Place Values:**
    *   57 + 21 = 78
    *   24 + 13 = 37
*   **Combine:** 37 hundreds and 78 ones results in 3778.

**Example 2 (from video 2:36):**
Problem: 2514 + 3216

*   **Split:**
    *   2514 becomes 25 (hundreds/thousands) and 14 (tens/ones)
    *   3216 becomes 32 (hundreds/thousands) and 16 (tens/ones)
*   **Add Place Values:**
    *   14 + 16 = 30
    *   25 + 32 = 57
*   **Combine:** 57 hundreds and 30 ones results in 5730.

**Example 3 (from video 2:44):**
Problem: 24561 + 14633

*   **Split:**
    *   24561 becomes 245 (hundreds/thousands) and 61 (tens/ones)
    *   14633 becomes 146 (hundreds/thousands) and 33 (tens/ones)
*   **Add Place Values:**
    *   61 + 33 = 94
    *   245 + 146 = 391
*   **Combine:** 391 hundreds and 94 ones results in 39194.

The video also briefly shows how this method can be applied to numbers with more digits (e.g., 43568 + 31256 + 31264 + 14758).  The key is to consistently split the numbers into two-digit or multi-digit segments and add them. This approach allows for mental calculation by breaking down a complex addition into simpler steps, promoting a deeper understanding of place value and number relationships.The user wants me to extract information about addition methods from the video. The video discusses a method called "Addition: Completing the Whole" and provides examples. I need to describe how this method works and extract the examples with their solutions, following the schema provided in the example.

## 3.Addition: Completing the Whole

This method provides a way to quickly add multiple numbers, especially for mental calculation, by grouping numbers to form multiples of 10 (or 100 for three-digit numbers) and then adding the remaining single digits.

**How it works:**

1.  **Separate tens/hundreds and units:** For each number in the addition problem, mentally separate the tens (or hundreds) digit from the units digit.
    *   Example: For 47, think of it as 40 and 7.

2.  **Add the tens/hundreds:** Sum all the tens (or hundreds) values together first. This creates an initial sum that is a multiple of 10 (or 100).
    *   Example: For 47 + 58 + 25 + 37, add 40 + 50 + 20 + 30.

3.  **Add the units:** Sum all the units values separately.
    *   Example: For 47 + 58 + 25 + 37, add 7 + 8 + 5 + 7.

4.  **Combine the sums:** Add the sum of the tens/hundreds and the sum of the units to get the final answer.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: Two-digit numbers**
    *   Problem: $47 + 58 + 25 + 37$
    *   Adding tens: $40 + 50 + 20 + 30 = 140$
    *   Adding units: $7 + 8 + 5 + 7 = 27$
    *   Combine: $140 + 27 = 167$
    *   **Result:** 167

*   **Example 2: Two-digit numbers**
    *   Problem: $43 + 26 + 35 + 26$
    *   Adding tens: $40 + 20 + 30 + 20 = 110$
    *   Adding units: $3 + 6 + 5 + 6 = 20$
    *   Combine: $110 + 20 = 130$
    *   **Result:** 130

*   **Example 3: Two-digit numbers**
    *   Problem: $87 + 36 + 16 + 38$
    *   Adding tens: $80 + 30 + 10 + 30 = 150$
    *   Adding units: $7 + 6 + 6 + 8 = 27$
    *   Combine: $150 + 27 = 177$
    *   **Result:** 177

*   **Example 4: Three-digit numbers**
    *   Problem: $243 + 367 + 278 + 824$
    *   Adding hundreds: $200 + 300 + 200 + 800 = 1500$
    *   Adding tens: $40 + 60 + 70 + 20 = 190$
    *   Adding units: $3 + 7 + 8 + 4 = 22$
    *   Combine: $1500 + 190 + 22 = 1712$
    *   **Result:** 1712

*   **Example 5: Three-digit numbers**
    *   Problem: $268 + 964 + 365 + 156$
    *   Adding hundreds: $200 + 900 + 300 + 100 = 1500$
    *   Adding tens: $60 + 60 + 60 + 50 = 230$
    *   Adding units: $8 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 23$
    *   Combine: $1500 + 230 + 23 = 1753$
    *   **Result:** 1753

**Key Points:**

*   This method simplifies addition by breaking down numbers into their place values and adding them in groups.
*   It's particularly useful for mental math as it reduces the need for carrying over digits immediately.
*   Practice with single-digit addition is crucial to improve speed and accuracy with this method.
*   The video emphasizes practicing adding single digits randomly (e.g., 8+7, 9+3, 6+4, 5+3, 7+7, 9+7) to become accustomed to quickly recalling sums.
*   It also recommends progressing from single-digit practice to two-digit, three-digit, and higher additions.
* This video illustrates a technique for performing addition from left to right, contrasting it with the traditional right-to-left method. It emphasizes that consistent practice is crucial for increasing speed and improving number visualization skills.

## 4.Addition: Left to Right

This method reverses the traditional addition process, starting from the leftmost digits (highest place value) and moving to the right. It involves mentally carrying over values as you proceed.

**How it works:**

1.  **Add the leftmost digits:** Sum the digits in the leftmost column and write down the sum at the left most end
2.  Record the sum: Move to the next column to the right and do the sum, if the sum is a two-digit number, write the units digit and mentally carry over the tens digit to the next column's sum.
3.  **Continue to the right:** Move to the next column to the right and repeat the process, adding the digits in that column along with any carried-over value.
4.  **Adjust for carries:** If a sum in a column results in a two-digit number, the tens digit of that sum needs to be added to the digit immediately to its left (from the previous sum).

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 748 + 536**
    *   **Step 1:** Add the hundreds digits: $7 + 5 = 12$. Write down '12'.
    *   **Step 2:** Add the tens digits: $4 + 3 = 7$.
    *   **Step 3:** Notice that the next sum (units digits) will involve a carry. $8 + 6 = 14$. So, the '7' from the tens digit sum will become '8' (7 + 1 carry). Write down '84'.
    *   **Result:** $1284$

*   **Example 2: 598 + 274**
    *   **Step 1:** Add the hundreds digits: $5 + 2 = 7$. Write down '7'.
    *   **Step 2:** Add the tens digits: $9 + 7 = 16$. Since it's a two-digit number, add '1' to the '7' from the previous sum (making it '8'), and write '6' after it. So far, "86".
    *   **Step 3:** Add the units digits: $8 + 4 = 12$. Since it's a two-digit number, add '1' to the '6' from the previous step (making it '7'), and write '2' after it. So far, "872".
    *   **Result:** $872$

*   **Example 3: 315 + 467**
    *   **Step 1:** Add the hundreds digits: $3 + 4 = 7$. Write down '7'.
    *   **Step 2:** Add the tens digits: $1 + 6 = 7$. Write down '7'.
    *   **Step 3:** Add the units digits: $5 + 7 = 12$. Since it's a two-digit number, add '1' to the '7' from the previous step (making it '8'), and write '2' after it.
    *   **Result:** $782$

*   **Example 4: 1567 + 2578 + 1688**
    *   **Step 1:** Add the thousands digits: $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$. Write down '4'.
    *   **Step 2:** Add the hundreds digits: $5 + 5 + 6 = 16$. Add '1' to the '4' (making it '5'), and write '6' after it. So far, "56".
    *   **Step 3:** Add the tens digits: $6 + 7 + 8 = 21$. Add '2' to the '6' (making it '8'), and write '1' after it. So far, "581".
    *   **Step 4:** Add the units digits: $7 + 8 + 8 = 23$. Add '2' to the '1' (making it '3'), and write '3' after it.
    *   **Result:** $5833$

*   **Example 5: 3789 + 1575 + 3678**
    *   **Step 1:** Add the thousands digits: $3 + 1 + 3 = 7$. Write down '7'.
    *   **Step 2:** Add the hundreds digits: $7 + 5 + 6 = 18$. Add '1' to the '7' (making it '8'), and write '8' after it. So far, "88".
    *   **Step 3:** Add the tens digits: $8 + 7 + 7 = 22$. Add '2' to the '8' (making it '0'), and write '2' after it. So far, "902".
    *   **Step 4:** Add the units digits: $9 + 5 + 8 = 22$. Add '2' to the '2' (making it '4'), and write '2' after it.
    *   **Result:** $9042$

*   **Example 6: 12453 + 25765 + 25689**
    *   **Step 1:** Add the ten thousands digits: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. Write down '5'.
    *   **Step 2:** Add the thousands digits: $2 + 5 + 5 = 12$. Add '1' to the '5' (making it '6'), and write '2' after it. So far, "62".
    *   **Step 3:** Add the hundreds digits: $4 + 7 + 6 = 17$. Add '1' to the '2' (making it '3'), and write '7' after it. So far, "637".
    *   **Step 4:** Add the tens digits: $5 + 6 + 8 = 19$. Add '1' to the '7' (making it '9'), and write '0' after it. So far, "6390".
    *   **Step 5:** Add the units digits: $3 + 5 + 9 = 17$. Add '1' to the '0' (making it '1'), and write '7' after it.
    *   **Result:** $63907$

**Key Points:**

*   This left-to-right method is a mental math technique that, with practice, can increase calculation speed and improve number visualization.
*   It does not require an abacus, but regular practice with random digit numbers is recommended to master it.
*   The video encourages viewers to try this method as an alternative to traditional right-to-left addition and find what works best for them.The user provided a video about addition tricks, not integration. Thus, the prior extraction format is not applicable. I will extract information from the video on addition tricks in a suitable format.

## 5.Addition Trick: Pairing Numbers

This trick provides a shortcut for adding a list of numbers by pairing numbers that sum to 10 or multiples of 10.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify pairs:** Look for numbers in the list whose unit digits add up to 10. These form pairs that are easy to add mentally.
    *   Example: For the sum $75 + 26 + 84 + 36 + 45$:
        *   $75$ and $45$ (unit digits $5+5=10$)
        *   $84$ and $36$ (unit digits $4+6=10$)
        *   $26$ (left over)

2.  **Add the pairs:** Add the numbers in each identified pair.
    *   $75 + 45 = 120$ (mentally: $70+40=110$, $5+5=10$, $110+10=120$)
    *   $84 + 36 = 120$ (mentally: $80+30=110$, $4+6=10$, $110+10=120$)

3.  **Add remaining numbers and sums:** Add the results from step 2 and any remaining numbers in the list.
    *   $120 + 120 = 240$
    *   $240 + 26 = 266$

**General Strategy:**

*   **Practice pairs of 10:** Memorize pairs of single-digit numbers that sum to 10 (e.g., $1+9, 2+8, 3+7, 4+6, 5+5$). This is crucial for speed.
*   **Split numbers for easier addition:** When adding two-digit numbers, you can split them. For instance, to add $84 + 36$, add $84+6 = 90$, then add the remaining $30$ from $36$ to get $120$.
*   **Mental math:** The goal is to perform these additions mentally through practice.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $75 + 26 + 84 + 36 + 45$
    *   Pairs: $(75 + 45)$ and $(84 + 36)$. Remaining: $26$.
    *   Calculations:
        *   $75 + 45 = 120$
        *   $84 + 36 = 120$
        *   $120 + 120 + 26 = 240 + 26 = 266$
    *   **Result:** $266$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $47 + 36 + 23 + 44 + 52$
    *   Pairs: $(47 + 23)$ and $(36 + 44)$. Remaining: $52$.
    *   Calculations:
        *   $47 + 23 = 70$ (mentally: $47+3=50$, $50+20=70$)
        *   $36 + 44 = 80$ (mentally: $36+4=40$, $40+40=80$)
        *   $70 + 80 + 52 = 150 + 52 = 202$
    *   **Result:** $202$

*   **Example 3 (Three-digit numbers):**
    *   Problem: $512 + 328 + 654 + 276 + 398$

        *   $840 + 930 + 398 = 1770 + 398 = 2168$
    *   **Result:** $2168$

*   **Example 4 (Three-digit numbers):**
    *   Problem: $425 + 643 + 168 + 325 + 417$
    *   Pairs based on unit digits:
        *   $(425 + 325)$ (unit digits $5+5=10$)
        *   $(643 + 417)$ (unit digits $3+7=10$)
        *   $168$ (left over)
    *   Calculations shown in the video:
        *   $425 + 325 = 750$ (mentally: $425+25=450$, $450+300=750$)
        *   $643 + 417 = 1060$ (mentally: $643+7=650$, $650+410=1060$)
        *   $750 + 1060 + 168 = 1810 + 168 = 1978$
    *   **Result:** $1978$

* ## 8.Addition of Series of a Number

This trick provides a shortcut for adding a series of numbers where each subsequent number is formed by repeating the same digit an increasing number of times.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the repeating digit and the maximum number of repetitions:**
    *   In the given series, identify the single digit that is being repeated throughout the series.
    *   Count the number of times this digit is repeated in the *largest* number in the series. This will be the "maximum repetitions."
    *   Example 1: $2 + 22 + 222$
        *   Repeating digit: 2
        *   Maximum repetitions: 3 (from 222)
    *   Example 2: $3 + 33 + 333 + 3333 + 33333$
        *   Repeating digit: 3
        *   Maximum repetitions: 5 (from 33333)

2.  **Form a sequence of ascending numbers:**
    *   Create a new number by writing digits in ascending order, starting from 1, up to the "maximum repetitions" determined in step 1.
    *   Example 1 (max 3 repetitions): 123
    *   Example 2 (max 5 repetitions): 12345

3.  **Multiply by the repeating digit:**
    *   Multiply the number formed in step 2 by the repeating digit identified in step 1. This product will be the sum of the series.
    *   Example 1: $123 \times 2$
    *   Example 2: $12345 \times 3$

**General Formula:**

If the series is $D + DD + DDD + \dots + \underbrace{D D \dots D}_{\text{N times}}$, where D is the repeating digit and N is the maximum number of repetitions, the sum is:
$$ (123\dots N) \times D $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $2 + 22 + 222$
    *   Repeating digit: 2
    *   Maximum repetitions: 3
    *   Calculation: $123 \times 2 = 246$
    *   **Result:** 246

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $3 + 33 + 333 + 3333 + 33333$
    *   Repeating digit: 3
    *   Maximum repetitions: 5
    *   Calculation: $12345 \times 3 = 37035$
    *   **Result:** 37035

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $5 + 55 + 555 + 5555 + 55555 + 555555 + 5555555$
    *   Repeating digit: 5
    *   Maximum repetitions: 7
    *   Calculation: $1234567 \times 5 = 6172835$
    *   **Result:** 6172835

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: $4 + 44 + 444$
    *   Repeating digit: 4
    *   Maximum repetitions: 3
    *   Calculation: $123 \times 4 = 492$
    *   **Result:** 492

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is a quick and efficient method for summing series of repeated digits.
*   It simplifies calculations that would otherwise involve lengthy manual addition.
*   The number of digits in the ascending sequence is determined by the maximum number of times the repeating digit appears in any term of the series.
*   This method is particularly useful for competitive exams and Olympiads.
* ## 9.Multiplication Tables 10 to 20

This trick provides a simple and fast method for multiplying two-digit numbers between 10 and 20.

**How it works:**

1.  **Multiply the units digits:** Multiply the units digits of both numbers. Write down the units digit of this product, and carry over the tens digit (if any).
    *   Example 1: For $11 \times 12$, multiply $1 \times 2 = 2$. Write down 2. (No carry-over).
    *   Example 2: For $12 \times 13$, multiply $2 \times 3 = 6$. Write down 6. (No carry-over).
    *   Example 3: For $13 \times 14$, multiply $3 \times 4 = 12$. Write down 2, carry over 1.
    *   Example 4: For $15 \times 16$, multiply $5 \times 6 = 30$. Write down 0, carry over 3.

2.  **Add the first number to the units digit of the second number (and any carry-over):** Take the first complete number and add it to the units digit of the second number. Then, add any carry-over from step 1 to this sum. This result forms the leading digits of your final answer.
    *   Example 1: For $11 \times 12$, add $11 + 2 = 13$. Add carry-over (0) = 13 Write down 13
    *   Example 2: For $12 \times 13$, add $12 + 3 = 15$. Add carry-over (0) = 15 Write down 15
    *   Example 3: For $13 \times 14$, add $13 + 4 = 17$. Add carry-over (1) = 18 Write down 18
    *   Example 4: For $15 \times 16$, add $15 + 6 = 21$. Add carry-over (3) = 24 Write down 24

3.  **Combine the results:** Concatenate the result from step 2 with the units digit from step 1 to get the final answer.
    *   Example 1: 13 (from step 2) and 2 (from step 1) combine to make 132.
    *   Example 2: 15 (from step 2) and 6 (from step 1) combine to make 156.
    *   Example 3: 18 (from step 2) and 2 (from step 1) combine to make 182.
    *   Example 4: 24 (from step 2) and 0 (from step 1) combine to make 240.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $11 \times 12$
    *   Step 1: $1 \times 2 = 2$ (units digit is 2, carry-over 0) 
    *   Step 2: 11 + 2 = 13+ 0 = 13
    *   **Result:** 132

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $12 \times 13$
    *   Step 1: $2 \times 3 = 6$ (units digit is 6, carry-over 0)
    *   Step 2: $12 + 3 = 15 + 0 = 15
    *   **Result:** 156

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $13 \times 14$
    *   Step 1: $3 \times 4 = 12$ (units digit is 2, carry-over 1)
    *   Step 2: $13 + 4 = 17  + 1 = 18
    *   **Result:** 182

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: $15 \times 16$
    *   Step 1: $5 \times 6 = 30$ (units digit is 0, carry-over 3)
    *   Step 2: $15 + 6 = 21+ 3 = 24
    *   **Result:** 240

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is specifically designed for multiplying two numbers where both numbers are between 10 and 20 (inclusive).
*   It significantly reduces the complexity of mental arithmetic for these specific multiplications.
*   Practice is key to mastering this method for quick calculations.
* ## 10.Table Rote Learning

This video introduces a method called "Table Rote Learning" for memorizing multiplication tables, particularly useful for larger numbers. Unlike sequential memorization (e.g., $28 \times 1, 28 \times 2, \dots$), this method encourages learning individual products randomly.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the multiplication table to be learned:** The method applies to any multiplication table. The video uses the example of the "Multiplication Table of 28."
    *   Example: Multiplication table of 28.

2.  **Focus on specific, non-sequential products:** Instead of reciting the table from $1 \times D$ to $10 \times D$ (where D is the digit), concentrate on memorizing particular products in a random order.
    *   Example: For the 28 times table, instead of starting with $28 \times 1 = 28$, you might first learn $28 \times 5 = 140$, then $28 \times 8 = 224$, then $28 \times 2 = 56$, and so on.

3.  **Repeat these random products frequently:** The core of "rote learning" is repetition. Continuously recall and state the randomly selected products until they are firmly committed to memory.
    *   Example: After learning $28 \times 5 = 140$, try to recall it multiple times. Then learn $28 \times 8 = 224$ and practice recalling both $28 \times 5$ and $28 \times 8$.

4.  **Gradually add more random products:** As you become proficient with a few random products, introduce new ones in a non-sequential manner.
    *   Example: After mastering $28 \times 5 = 140$ and $28 \times 8 = 224$, you might add $28 \times 3 = 84$ to your practice.

5.  **Revisit previously learned random products regularly:** To ensure long-term retention, continuously test yourself on a mix of all the random products you have learned so far, rather than just the newest ones.

**Examples from the video (focused on specific products for the 28 times table):**

The video demonstrates the rote learning process by circling various products from the multiplication table of 28, suggesting they be learned randomly. These include:

*   $28 \times 1 = 28$
*   $28 \times 2 = 56$
*   $28 \times 3 = 84$
*   $28 \times 4 = 112$
*   $28 \times 5 = 140$
*   $28 \times 6 = 168$
*   $28 \times 7 = 196$
*   $28 \times 8 = 224$
*   $28 \times 9 = 252$
*   $28 \times 10 = 280$

The instructor emphasizes practicing these in a random order, such as:
*   $28 \times 5 = 140$
*   $28 \times 8 = 224$
*   $28 \times 2 = 56$
*   $28 \times 3 = 84$
*   $28 \times 9 = 252$
*   $28 \times 4 = 112$
*   $28 \times 6 = 168$
*   $28 \times 7 = 196$
*   $28 \times 1 = 28$
*   $28 \times 10 = 280$

**Key Points:**

*   **Randomized Learning:** This method deviates from traditional sequential memorization, aiming for quicker recall of individual products regardless of their order in the table.
*   **Repetition is Crucial:** Consistent and repeated practice of the randomly selected products is fundamental to this learning technique.
*   **Application:** While tables up to 10 or 12 are often learned sequentially, this method can be beneficial for larger tables (like 28 in the example) or for memorizing specific values from trigonometry or logarithms where sequential recall is not always necessary.
*   **Personal Preference:** The instructor notes that this is just one method, and learners should choose the approach that best suits their learning style.
* ## 11.Table Multiplication Trick (1 to 100)

This trick provides a shortcut for multiplying a two-digit number by a single-digit number, essentially making it easier to learn and recall multiplication tables up to 100 without rote memorization.

**How it works:**

1.  **Multiply the tens digit of the two-digit number by the single-digit multiplier.** Record this result.
2.  **Multiply the units digit of the two-digit number by the single-digit multiplier.** Record this result.
3.  **Combine the results:**
    *   Take the units digit from the result of step 2.
    *   Add the tens digit (or carry-over) from the result of step 2 to the entire result obtained in step 1.
    *   Place the combined sum from the previous point before the units digit from the result of step 2 to form the final answer.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 75 x 8**
    1.  Tens digit multiplication: $7 \times 8 = 56$.
    2.  Units digit multiplication: $5 \times 8 = 40$.
    3.  Combine and add:
        *   Units digit from step 2: 0.
        *   Tens digit from step 2 (4) added to result of step 1: $56 + 4 = 60$.
        *   **Result:** 600.

*   **Example 2: 68 x 7**
    1.  Tens digit multiplication: $6 \times 7 = 42$.
    2.  Units digit multiplication: $8 \times 7 = 56$.
    3.  Combine and add:
        *   Units digit from step 2: 6.
        *   Tens digit from step 2 (5) added to result of step 1: $42 + 5 = 47$.
        *   **Result:** 476.

*   **Example 3: 46 x 6**
    1.  Tens digit multiplication: $4 \times 6 = 24$.
    2.  Units digit multiplication: $6 \times 6 = 36$.
    3.  Combine and add:
        *   Units digit from step 2: 6.
        *   Tens digit from step 2 (3) added to result of step 1: $24 + 3 = 27$.
        *   **Result:** 276.

**Practice Examples (with solutions from the video):**

*   **54 x 4:**
    *   $5 \times 4 = 20$
    *   $4 \times 4 = 16$
    *   Combine: $20 + 1 = 21$, append 6.
    *   **Result:** 216.

*   **38 x 9:**
    *   $3 \times 9 = 27$
    *   $8 \times 9 = 72$
    *   Combine: $27 + 7 = 34$, append 2.
    *   **Result:** 342.

*   **84 x 5:**
    *   $8 \times 5 = 40$
    *   $4 \times 5 = 20$
    *   Combine: $40 + 2 = 42$, append 0.
    *   **Result:** 420.

*   **32 x 4:**
    *   $3 \times 4 = 12$
    *   $2 \times 4 = 8$
    *   Combine: Since 8 is a single digit, there is no tens digit to add. So, simply append 8 to 12.
    *   **Result:** 128.

**Key Points:**

*   This method emphasizes understanding the process rather than rote memorization.
*   It breaks down larger multiplication problems into simpler, manageable steps.
*   Consistent practice of this technique allows for rapid mental calculation of multiplication tables up to 100.
*   When the multiplication of the units digit results in a single-digit number (e.g., $2 \times 4 = 8$), there is no "tens digit" to carry over and add to the first result; you simply append the single-digit result.
* ## 12.Subtraction Trick: General Method

This trick outlines a standard borrowing method for subtraction, particularly useful when the digit being subtracted is larger than the digit it's being subtracted from.

**How it works:**

1.  **Start from the rightmost digit:** Begin subtraction from the units place (rightmost digit).
2.  **Borrow when necessary:** If the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit in a column, borrow 1 from the digit to its left.
    *   This borrowed 1 is equivalent to 10 in the current column. Add 10 to the top digit and then subtract the bottom digit.
    *   Reduce the digit from which you borrowed by 1.
3.  **Repeat for each column:** Continue this process for each column, moving from right to left, until all digits have been subtracted.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 4763 - 2578**
    1.  **Units column:** 3 - 8. Since 3 is smaller than 8, borrow 1 from 6 (making it 5). The 3 becomes 13.
        *   $13 - 8 = 5$.
    2.  **Tens column:** 5 - 7 (since 6 became 5). Since 5 is smaller than 7, borrow 1 from 7 (making it 6). The 5 becomes 15.
        *   $15 - 7 = 8$.
    3.  **Hundreds column:** 6 - 5 (since 7 became 6).
        *   $6 - 5 = 1$.
    4.  **Thousands column:** 4 - 2.
        *   $4 - 2 = 2$.
    *   **Result:** 2185.

*   **Example 2: 3789 - 1575**
    1.  **Units column:** $9 - 5 = 4$.
    2.  **Tens column:** $8 - 7 = 1$.
    3.  **Hundreds column:** $7 - 5 = 2$.
    4.  **Thousands column:** $3 - 1 = 2$.
    *   **Result:** 2214.

*   **Example 3: 57863 - 25765**
    1.  **Units column:** 3 - 5. Since 3 is smaller than 5, borrow 1 from 6 (making it 5). The 3 becomes 13.
        *   $13 - 5 = 8$.
    2.  **Tens column:** 5 - 6 (since 6 became 5). Since 5 is smaller than 6, borrow 1 from 8 (making it 7). The 5 becomes 15.
        *   $15 - 6 = 9$.
    3.  **Hundreds column:** 7 - 7 (since 8 became 7).
        *   $7 - 7 = 0$.
    4.  **Thousands column:** 7 - 5.
        *   $7 - 5 = 2$.
    5.  **Ten Thousands column:** 5 - 2.
        *   $5 - 2 = 3$.
    *   **Result:** 32098.
*   **Example 4**:8633-5412
*         **Units column**: 3-2
*                      3-2=1
*          **Tens column**: 3-1
*                       3-1=2
*            **Hundreds column**: 6-4
*                        6-4=2
*           **Thousands column**: 8-5
*                         8-5=3
*            **Result**: 3221
*                  
* 

**Key Points:**

*   This is a fundamental method for subtraction that relies on understanding place value and borrowing.
*   The key is to remember to reduce the digit from which you borrowed by one.
*   Practice with various numbers helps in mastering this technique for quick and accurate subtraction.
*   The video primarily focuses on demonstrating the traditional method of subtraction with borrowing.
* ## 13.Subtraction - Multiple of Base

This trick provides a shortcut for subtracting a number from a multiple of a base (e.g., 5000, 70000, 20000).

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the numbers:** You have a multiple of a base (e.g., 5000) and a number to subtract (e.g., 2646).
2.  **Align the digits:** Ensure that the number being subtracted has the same number of digits as the zeros in the multiple of the base by adding leading zeros if necessary.
    *   Example: For 7000 - 58, 58 has two digits, and 7000 has three zeros. So, consider 058.

3.  **Subtract the last digit from 10:** Take the last digit of the number being subtracted and subtract it from 10. This will be the last digit of your answer.
    *   Example: For 5000 - 2646, the last digit is 6. $10 - 6 = 4$.

4.  **Subtract the remaining digits (up to the zeros) from 9:** For all other digits in the number being subtracted that correspond to the zeros in the multiple of the base, subtract them from 9.
    *   Example: For 5000 - 2646, the remaining digits corresponding to zeros are 4 and 6. So, $9 - 4 = 5$ and $9 - 6 = 3$.

5.  **Subtract 1 from the leading digit:** Take the leading digit of the multiple of the base (e.g., 5 from 5000) and subtract the leading digit of the number being subtracted (e.g., 2 from 2646). Then, subtract 1 from this result.
    *   Example: For 5000 - 2646, the leading digits are 5 and 2. So, $(5 - 2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: 5000 - 2646
    *   Last digit: $10 - 6 = 4$
    *   Remaining zero-aligned digits: $9 - 4 = 5$, $9 - 6 = 3$
    *   Leading digit: $(5 - 2) - 1 = 2$
    *   **Result:** 2354

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: 70000 - 52365
    *   Last digit: $10 - 5 = 5$
    *   Remaining zero-aligned digits: $9 - 6 = 3$, $9 - 3 = 6$, $9 - 2 = 7$
    *   Leading digit: $(7 - 5) - 1 = 1$
    *   **Result:** 17635

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: 20000 - 5673
    *   Adjusted to 5 digits: 20000 - 05673
    *   Last digit: $10 - 3 = 7$
    *   Remaining zero-aligned digits: $9 - 7 = 2$, $9 - 6 = 3$, $9 - 5 = 4$
    *   Leading digit: $(2 - 0) - 1 = 1$
    *   **Result:** 14327

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: 7000 - 58
    *   Adjusted to 4 digits: 7000 - 0058
    *   Last digit: $10 - 8 = 2$
    *   Remaining zero-aligned digits: $9 - 5 = 4$, $9 - 0 = 9$
    *   Leading digit: $(7 - 0) - 1 = 6$
    *   **Result:** 6942

*   **Example 5:**
    *   Problem: 75000 - 588
    *   Adjusted to 5 digits: 75000 - 00588
    *   Last digit: $10 - 8 = 2$
    *   Remaining zero-aligned digits: $9 - 8 = 1$, $9 - 5 = 4$
    *   Leading digits: $(75 - 0) - 1 = 74$
    *   **Result:** 74412

*   **Example 6:**
    *   Problem: 30000 - 94
    *   Adjusted to 5 digits: 30000 - 00094
    *   Last digit: $10 - 4 = 6$
    *   Remaining zero-aligned digits: $9 - 9 = 0$, $9 - 0 = 9$, $9 - 0 = 9$
    *   Leading digits: $(3 - 0) - 1 = 2$
    *   **Result:** 29906

**Key Points:**

*   This method is particularly useful for mental calculations or quick estimations when subtracting from numbers that are multiples of powers of 10.
*   The key is to apply the "all from 9, last from 10" rule to the digits corresponding to the zeros, and then adjust the leading digits.
*   Remember to add leading zeros to the subtrahend to match the number of trailing zeros in the minuend.


    ## 14.Subtraction - Base Method

This method offers a simplified approach to subtracting numbers from a "base" number, which is a number consisting of a '1' followed by one or more zeros (e.g., 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, etc.).

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the Base and the Subtrahend:**
    *   The "base" is the number with '1' followed by zeros.
    *   The "subtrahend" is the number being subtracted.

2.  **Ensure Equal Number of Digits for Subtraction (if necessary):**
    *   Count the number of zeros in the base number. This is the number of digits your answer will have.
    *   If the subtrahend has fewer digits than the number of zeros in the base, add leading zeros to the subtrahend until it has the same number of digits as the zeros in the base.

3.  **Apply the "All from 9, Last from 10" Rule:**
    *   **Last Digit:** Subtract the last (rightmost) digit of the modified subtrahend from 10.
    *   **Remaining Digits (from right to left):** Subtract each of the remaining digits of the modified subtrahend from 9.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 10000 - 5678**
    *   Base: 10000 (4 zeros)
    *   Subtrahend: 5678 (4 digits) - No leading zeros needed.
    *   Calculations:
        *   Last digit: $10 - 8 = 2$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 7 = 2$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 6 = 3$
        *   First digit: $9 - 5 = 4$
    *   **Result:** 4322

*   **Example 2: 1000 - 576**
    *   Base: 1000 (3 zeros)
    *   Subtrahend: 576 (3 digits) - No leading zeros needed.
    *   Calculations:
        *   Last digit: $10 - 6 = 4$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 7 = 2$
        *   First digit: $9 - 5 = 4$
    *   **Result:** 424

*   **Example 3: 100000 - 43567**
    *   Base: 100000 (5 zeros)
    *   Subtrahend: 43567 (5 digits) - No leading zeros needed.
    *   Calculations:
        *   Last digit: $10 - 7 = 3$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 6 = 3$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 5 = 4$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 3 = 6$
        *   First digit: $9 - 4 = 5$
    *   **Result:** 56433

*   **Example 4: 10000 - 468**
    *   Base: 10000 (4 zeros)
    *   Subtrahend: 468 (3 digits)
    *   Add leading zero to subtrahend: 0468
    *   Calculations:
        *   Last digit: $10 - 8 = 2$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 6 = 3$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 4 = 5$
        *   First digit: $9 - 0 = 9$
    *   **Result:** 9532

*   **Example 5: 1000000 - 6873**
    *   Base: 1000000 (6 zeros)
    *   Subtrahend: 6873 (4 digits)
    *   Add leading zeros to subtrahend: 006873
    *   Calculations:
        *   Last digit: $10 - 3 = 7$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 7 = 2$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 8 = 1$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 6 = 3$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 0 = 9$
        *   First digit: $9 - 0 = 9$
    *   **Result:** 993127

*   **Example 6: 100000 - 57**
    *   Base: 100000 (5 zeros)
    *   Subtrahend: 57 (2 digits)
    *   Add leading zeros to subtrahend: 00057
    *   Calculations:

        *   Next digit: $9 - 0 = 9$
        *   Next digit: $9 - 0 = 9$
        *   First digit: $9 - 0 = 9$
    *   **Result:** 99943

**Key Points:**

*   This method is particularly useful for mental math when subtracting from powers of 10.
*   The crucial step is to ensure the subtrahend has the same number of digits as the zeros in the base number by adding leading zeros.
* ## 15.Subtraction: Number Splitting Method

This method simplifies subtraction by splitting numbers into smaller, easier-to-manage parts. It's particularly useful for mental calculations and can be adapted based on individual preference. The core idea is to break down the subtrahend (the number being subtracted) and subtract its parts sequentially from the minuend (the number from which another is subtracted).

**How it works (using examples from the video):**

**Example 1: 7582 - 1954**

1.  **Split the subtrahend:** The subtrahend is 1954. We can split it into 1000, 900, 50, and 4.
2.  **Subtract in parts:**
    *   Subtract 1000 from 7582: $7582 - 1000 = 6582$
    *   Subtract 900 from 6582: $6582 - 900 = 5682$
    *   Subtract 50 from 5682: $5682 - 50 = 5632$
    *   Subtract 4 from 5632: $5632 - 4 = 5628$

    Alternatively, as shown in the video, one could split the numbers from the rightmost digits.

    *   Split into two-digit numbers: 75 | 82 and 19 | 54
    *   Subtract the rightmost parts: $82 - 54 = 28$
    *   Subtract the leftmost parts: $75 - 19 = 56$
    *   Combine the results: $5628$

**Example 2: 27935 - 14632**

1.  **Split the subtrahend:** The subtrahend is 14632. We can split it into 10000, 4000, 600, 30, and 2.
2.  **Subtract in parts:**
    *   Subtract 10000 from 27935: $27935 - 10000 = 17935$
    *   Subtract 4000 from 17935: $17935 - 4000 = 13935$
    *   Subtract 600 from 13935: $13935 - 600 = 13335$
    *   Subtract 30 from 13335: $13335 - 30 = 13305$
    *   Subtract 2 from 13305: $13305 - 2 = 13303$

    Alternatively, as shown in the video, one could split the numbers into groups.

    *   Split into groups: 27 | 93 | 5 and 14 | 63 | 2
    *   Subtract the rightmost parts: $35 - 32 = 03$ (written as two digits)
    *   Subtract the middle parts: $79 - 46 = 33$
    *   Subtract the leftmost parts: $2 - 1 = 1$
    *   Combine the results: $13303$

**Example 3: 57362 - 15854**

1.  **Split the subtrahend:** The subtrahend is 15854.
2.  **Subtract in parts (as shown in the video):**
    *   Split into groups: 57 | 36 | 2 and 15 | 85 | 4
    *   Subtract the rightmost parts: $62 - 54 = 08$
    *   Subtract the middle parts: $73 - 58 = 15$
    *   Subtract the leftmost parts: $5 - 1 = 4$
    *   Combine the results: $41508$

**Example 4: 548724 - 152731**

1.  **Split the subtrahend:** The subtrahend is 152731.
2.  **Subtract in parts (as shown in the video):**
    *   Split into groups: 54 | 87 | 24 and 15 | 27 | 31
    *   Subtract the rightmost parts: $24 - 31$. Since 24 is smaller than 31, borrow from the left.
        *   Change 87 to 86 and 24 to 124.
        *   $124 - 31 = 93$
    *   Subtract the middle parts: $86 - 27 = 59$
    *   Subtract the leftmost parts: $54 - 15 = 39$
    *   Combine the results: $395993$

**Key Points:**

*   **Flexibility:** Numbers can be split into various groups (e.g., two digits, three digits, or based on place value) to simplify subtraction.
*   **Mental Calculation:** This method is particularly effective for performing subtraction mentally as it breaks down complex problems into simpler steps.
*   **Borrowing/Carrying:** When a digit or group of digits in the minuend is smaller than the corresponding part in the subtrahend, borrowing from the next higher place value (or group) is applied.
*   **Practice is Key:** Consistent practice with different number combinations helps in mastering this technique and improving calculation speed.
*   **Adaptability:** The method can be adapted to personal comfort and the specific numbers involved.
* ## 16.Number Peg System (1 to 10)

This section details a memory technique known as the "Number Peg System" for numbers 1 to 10. The presenter explains how to associate each number with a rhyming word (a "peg word") and, optionally, with specific letters. This system is designed to help memorize numbers by linking them to visual or auditory cues.

**How it works:**

The core idea is to create a strong association between a number and a concrete, easily recallable item or sound. This makes it easier to recall sequences of numbers or other data by mentally "pegging" them to these established associations.

**Peg Words (International Standard) and Associated Letters/Concepts:**

The presenter provides a list of internationally recognized peg words for numbers 1 to 10. He also demonstrates how to derive associated letters or concepts for each number, emphasizing that users can create their own more familiar associations.

*   **1. TOE:**
    *   Associated words/concepts: "Bun", "Sun", "Son" (due to the "un" sound in "one"). 
    *   Associated letter: 'T' (visually resembles the digit '1'). 
*   **2. NOAH:**
    *   Associated words/concepts: "Shoe" (due to the "oo" sound in "two"). 
    *   Associated letter: 'N' (has two vertical strokes). 
*   **3. MOW:**
    *   Associated words/concepts: "Tree" (due to the "ee" sound in "three"). 
    *   Associated letter: 'M' (has three vertical strokes when written in a certain style). 
*   **4. RYE:**
    *   Associated words/concepts: "Jar" (due to the "ar" sound in "four"). 
    *   Associated letter: 'R' (resembles the last letter sound of "four"). 
*   **5. LAW:**
    *   Associated words/concepts: "Hive" (due to the "ive" sound in "five"). 
    *   Associated letter: 'L' (resembles the Roman numeral for 50, or simply chosen for "law"). 
*   **6. SHOE:**
    *   Associated words/concepts: "Six" (direct rhyme, or a cricket "six"). 
    *   Associated letters: 'Sh' (sound associated with "six"). 
*   **7. COW:**
    *   Associated words/concepts: "Heaven" (due to the "even" sound in "seven").
    *   Associated letters: 'C', 'G' (sounds associated with "seven"). 
*   **8. IVY:**
    *   Associated words/concepts: "Gate" (due to the "ate" sound in "eight"). 
    *   Associated letter: 'V' (resembles the Roman numeral for 5, but here used for 8). 
*   **9. BEE:**
    *   Associated words/concepts: "Vine" (due to the "ine" sound in "nine").
    *   Associated letters: 'P', 'B' (sounds associated with "nine"). 
*   **10. DICE:**
    *   Associated words/concepts: "Ken" (due to the "en" sound in "ten"). 
    *   Associated letters: 'S', 'Z' (sounds associated with "ten"). 

**Applications and Benefits:**

The presenter emphasizes that this system, when practiced diligently from a young age, can greatly enhance memory for various numerical data, including:

*   Tables (multiplication, periodic table elements, logarithms) 
*   Large numbers (account numbers, long sequences of digits) 
*   Years and codes 
*   Scientific values (sine, cosine) 

He states that world-level memory champions utilize such peg systems to memorize vast amounts of numerical information. 

**Extending the System (10 to 20):**

The presenter briefly demonstrates how to extend the peg system to larger numbers by combining the established single-digit pegs.

*   **11. TOAD:**
    *   The number 11 can be associated with "TATA" (T for 1, A for nothing, T for 1, A for nothing). 
    *   The provided peg word "TOAD" uses 'T' for 1.
*   **12. TAN:**
    *   The number 12 can be associated with "TAN" (T for 1, N for 2) or "TANGO". 
*   **13. TOMB:**
    *   The number 13 can be associated with "TOMB" (T for 1, M for 3) or "TOMATO" (T for 1, M for 3, T for 1). 

**Memorizing Multi-Digit Numbers:**

The presenter gives examples of how to connect multi-digit numbers to words or stories based on the assigned letters.

*   **52 - Germanium:**
    *   Connect "52" to "Germanium" by associating "L" (for 5) and "N" (for 2) with a word like "LION" (L-N sound). The story would be "Germanium has a LION." 
*   **73 - Umbrella:**
    *   Connect "73" to "Umbrella" by associating "G" (for 7) and "M" (for 3) with a word like "GAME". The story would be "Umbrella GAME." 
*   **12^3 = 1728:**
    *   To remember that $12^3 = 1728$, one could associate the numbers with letters: T (1), G (7), N (2), V (8). This sequence, "TGNV", could then be linked to a word or phrase. 

**Conclusion:**

The presenter encourages viewers to practice learning the peg system's letters and forming words and stories to enhance their memory. He mentions that he uses a "photographic memory" training method, which is available in his online interactive classes. He reiterates that while there are various methods to memorize, the peg system is a widely recognized and effective technique for learning numbers.

The video demonstrates a "Subtraction - Complement Method" for performing subtraction, especially when dealing with borrowing in traditional subtraction. The method aims to simplify subtraction by converting it into an addition problem using complements.

## 17.Subtraction - Complement Method

This method provides a shortcut for performing subtraction, particularly when traditional borrowing might lead to confusion. It converts a subtraction problem into an addition problem by using the concept of complements.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the numbers:** You have a minuend (the number from which another number is subtracted) and a subtrahend (the number to be subtracted).
    *   Example: For `35795 - 14573`:
        *   Minuend: `35795`
        *   Subtrahend: `14573`

2.  **Adjust the minuend's digits:** For the first digit of the minuend (from the rightmost side), add 1 to it. For subsequent digits of the minuend (moving leftwards), subtract 1 from them.
    *   Example: For `35795`:
        *   The rightmost digit '5' becomes `5 + 1 = 6` (in mind, or noted as '10' if carrying over from an adjacent subtraction that becomes 9).
        *   The next digit '9' becomes `9 - 1 = 8`.
        *   And so on.

3.  **Find the 9's complement of the subtrahend:** For each digit in the subtrahend, find the number that, when added to it, equals 9.
    *   Example: For `14573`:
        *   Complement of `1` is `8` (`1 + 8 = 9`).
        *   Complement of `4` is `5` (`4 + 5 = 9`).
        *   Complement of `5` is `4` (`5 + 4 = 9`).
        *   Complement of `7` is `2` (`7 + 2 = 9`).
        *   Complement of `3` is `6` (`3 + 6 = 9`).
        *   The 9's complement of `14573` is `85426`.

4.  **Add the adjusted minuend and the complement of the subtrahend:** Perform addition on the adjusted minuend (from step 2, mentally or written) and the 9's complement of the subtrahend (from step 3).

5.  **Handle the carry-over (if any) and final adjustment:**
    *   If there is a carry-over from the leftmost digit of the addition, discard it.
    *   The remaining digits form the result.

**General steps (as demonstrated in the video with specific examples):**

The video demonstrates the method by:

*   **Performing a regular subtraction:**
    *   `35795 - 14573`
    *   `5 - 3 = 2`
    *   `9 - 7 = 2`
    *   `7 - 5 = 2`
    *   `5 - 4 = 1`
    *   `3 - 1 = 2`
    *   Result: `21222`

*   **Applying the Complement Method:**
    *   **Problem 1: `35379 - 24561`**
        1.  **Adjust minuend:** The video marks '9' in `35379` as '10' for the purpose of complement calculation for the first digit of the subtrahend, and '7' as '6' and '3' as '2'. (This is an unconventional notation but implies a manipulation for complement addition).
        2.  **Subtrahend's complement:** The video highlights `24561`.
            *   Complement for `1` (last digit) to reach `10` is `9`.
            *   Complements for `6, 5, 4, 2` to reach `9` are `3, 4, 5, 7` respectively.
            *   So, the complement value used for addition would effectively be `75439` (from left to right).
        3.  **Adding (mentally or as explained by the presenter):**
            *   `9` (from `35379`) + `9` (complement of `1`) = `18`. Keep `8`, carry `1`.
            *   `7` (becomes `6`) + `3` (complement of `6`) + `1` (carry) = `10`. Keep `0`, carry `1`.
            *   `3` (becomes `2`) + `4` (complement of `5`) + `1` (carry) = `7`. Keep `7`.
            *   `5` (from `35379`) + `5` (complement of `4`) = `10`. Keep `0`, carry `1`.
            *   `3` (becomes `2`) + `7` (complement of `2`) + `1` (carry) = `10`. Keep `0`, carry `1`.
            *   The final digit is `1` (from the last carry)
            *   The intermediate answer becomes `100720` (as indicated by the video's writing on screen).
            *   The final subtraction answer is obtained by "single-digiting" the last two-digit result, `10`, which becomes `1+0=1`. So the answer is `10818` (according to the video demonstration).

    *   **Problem 2: `25479 - 14759`**
        1.  **Adjust minuend:** The video highlights '9' in `25479` as '10' and '7' as '6'.
        2.  **Subtrahend's complement:** The video highlights `14759`.
            *   Complement for `9` (last digit) to reach `10` is `1`.
            *   Complements for `5, 7, 4, 1` to reach `9` are `4, 2, 5, 8` respectively.
            *   So, the complement value used for addition would effectively be `85241`.
        3.  **Adding (mentally or as explained by the presenter):**
            *   `9` (from `25479`) + `1` (complement of `9`) = `10`. Keep `0`, carry `1`.
            *   `7` (becomes `6`) + `4` (complement of `5`) + `1` (carry) = `11`. Keep `1`, carry `1`.
            *   `4` (from `25479`) + `2` (complement of `7`) + `1` (carry) = `7`. Keep `7`.
            *   `5` (from `25479`) + `5` (complement of `4`) = `10`. Keep `0`, carry `1`.
            *   `2` (from `25479`) + `8` (complement of `1`) + `1` (carry) = `11`. Keep `1`, carry `1`.
            *   The intermediate answer becomes `110710` (as indicated by the video's writing on screen).
            *   The final subtraction answer is obtained by "single-digiting" the last two-digit result, `10`, which becomes `1+0=1`. So the answer is `10720` (according to the video demonstration).

    *   **Problem 3: `79432 - 42841`**
        1.  **Adjust minuend:** The video marks '2' in `79432` as '3' and '3' as '2'. It marks '9' as '8' and '7' as '6'.
        2.  **Subtrahend's complement:** The video highlights `42841`.
            *   Complement for `1` (last digit) to reach `10` is `9`.
            *   Complements for `4, 8, 2, 4` to reach `9` are `5, 1, 7, 5` respectively.
            *   So, the complement value used for addition would effectively be `57159`.
        3.  **Adding (mentally or as explained by the presenter):**
            *   `2` (becomes `3`) + `9` (complement of `1`) = `12`. Keep `2`, carry `1`.
            *   `3` (becomes `2`) + `5` (complement of `4`) + `1` (carry) = `8`. Keep `8`.
            *   `4` (from `79432`) + `1` (complement of `8`) = `5`. Keep `5`.
            *   `9` (becomes `8`) + `7` (complement of `2`) = `15`. Keep `5`, carry `1`.
            *   `7` (becomes `6`) + `5` (complement of `4`) + `1` (carry) = `12`. Keep `2`, carry `1`.
            *   The intermediate answer becomes `125582` (as indicated by the video's writing on screen).
            *   The final subtraction answer is obtained by "single-digiting" the last two-digit result, `12`, which becomes `1+2=3`. So the answer is `36591` (according to the video demonstration).

    *   **Problem 4: `76483 - 28372`**
        1.  **Adjust minuend:** The video marks '3' in `76483` as '4', '8' as '7', '4' as '3', '6' as '5', and '7' as '6'.
        2.  **Subtrahend's complement:** The video highlights `28372`.
            *   Complement for `2` (last digit) to reach `10` is `8`.
            *   Complements for `7, 3, 8, 2` to reach `9` are `2, 6, 1, 7` respectively.
            *   So, the complement value used for addition would effectively be `71628`.
        3.  **Adding (mentally or as explained by the presenter):**
            *   `3` (becomes `4`) + `8` (complement of `2`) = `12`. Keep `2`, carry `1`.
            *   `8` (becomes `7`) + `2` (complement of `7`) + `1` (carry) = `10`. Keep `0`, carry `1`.
            *   `4` (becomes `3`) + `6` (complement of `3`) + `1` (carry) = `10`. Keep `0`, carry `1`.
            *   `6` (becomes `5`) + `1` (complement of `8`) + `1` (carry) = `7`. Keep `7`.
            *   `7` (becomes `6`) + `7` (complement of `2`) = `13`. Keep `3`, carry `1`.
            *   The intermediate answer becomes `137002` (as indicated by the video's writing on screen).
            *   The final subtraction answer is obtained by "single-digiting" the last two-digit result, `13`, which becomes `1+3=4`. So the answer is `48111` (according to the video demonstration).

**Key Points:**

*   This method can be faster than traditional subtraction, especially for multi-digit numbers.

The user wants to extract information about the addition dot method from the video. I will describe the method and provide the examples shown in the video.

### 18.**Addition dot method** 
The user is asking to extract information from the video about a mathematical trick called the "addition dot method". I need to analyze the video to understand how this method works and then present the examples given in the video.

Here's a plan:
1.  **Understand the "Addition Dot Method":** The presenter explains the core concept of the addition dot method. I'll describe what it is and how it differs from traditional addition.
2.  **Extract Examples:** The video shows two main examples:
    *   A two-digit addition problem (78 + 36).
    *   A three-digit addition problem (325 + 437 + 316).
    *   A multi-digit addition problem (78537 + 36482 + 21213 + 99785).
3.  **Detail the Steps for Each Example:** For each example, I will outline how the dot method is applied, showing how carries are handled by placing dots.
4.  **Summarize Key Benefits:** The presenter mentions benefits like speed and mental calculation, which should be included.

I will now process the video content to extract this information.## Addition Dot Method

The Addition Dot Method is a technique for performing addition, particularly useful for increasing calculation speed and enabling mental arithmetic. Instead of carrying over numbers, a dot is placed next to the digit in the current column when a sum of 10 or more is reached. This dot represents a 'carry-over' of 1 to the next column.

### How it works:

1.  **Add digits in a column:** Start from the rightmost column (units place) and add the digits.
2.  **Handle carries with dots:** If the sum of the digits in a column is 10 or greater, write down only the units digit of the sum. For every 10 that is carried over, place a dot next to the digit in the *next* column (to the left) that was part of the addition that caused the carry.
3.  **Continue to the left:** Move to the next column to the left. Add the digits in this column, along with any dots (each dot counting as 1). Repeat the process of handling carries with dots.
4.  **Final sum:** Continue this process until all columns have been added.

### Examples from the video:

**Example 1: Adding 78 + 36**

*   **Units Column (rightmost):**
    *   8 + 6 = 14.
    *   Write down '4' in the units place of the result.
    *   Since 10 was carried over, place a dot next to '7' in the tens column.

*   **Tens Column (next to the left):**
    *   Add the digits: 7 + 3 = 10.
    *   Add the dot: 10 + 1 (from the dot) = 11.
    *   Write down '1' in the tens place of the result.
    *   Since there's a carry from 11, write down '1' in the hundreds place of the result.

*   **Result:** 114.

**Example 2: Adding 325 + 437 + 316**

*   **Units Column:**
    *   5 + 7 = 12.
    *   12 + 6 = 18.
    *   Write down '8'.
    *   Place a dot next to '2' in the tens column (representing the carry of 1).

*   **Tens Column:**
    *   Add the digits: 2 + 3 = 5.
    *   5 + 1 = 6.
    *   Add the dot: 6 + 1 (from the dot) = 7.
    *   Write down '7'.

*   **Hundreds Column:**
    *   Add the digits: 3 + 4 = 7.
    *   7 + 3 = 10.
    *   Write down '0'.
    *   Place a dot next to the '3' (representing the carry of 1), and then carry over the dot to the next position.
    *   Write down '1' in the thousands place.

*   **Result:** 1078.

**Example 3: Adding 78537 + 36482 + 21213 + 99785 (Left-to-Right Mental Calculation)**

This example demonstrates how to perform addition mentally by adding columns from left to right and accumulating the results. This is shown by writing down each column's sum, then combining them.

*   **Original Column Sums (from left to right):**
    *   (7 + 3 + 2 + 9) = 21 (for the leftmost column)
    *   (8 + 6 + 1 + 9) = 24
    *   (5 + 4 + 2 + 7) = 18
    *   (3 + 8 + 1 + 8) = 20
    *   (7 + 2 + 3 + 5) = 17 (for the rightmost column)
    *   This gives a series of numbers: 21, 24, 18, 20, 17.

*   **Combining the sums (mental adjustment for carries):**
    *   Start with 21.
    *   Add the '2' from the '24' to the '21', making '23'. (21 + 2 = 23)
    *   Keep '4' from '24'. So far: 23 4
    *   Add the '1' from '18' to the '4', making '5'. (4 + 1 = 5)
    *   Keep '8' from '18'. So far: 23 5 8
    *   Add the '2' from '20' to the '8', making '10'. This is a carry. Carry '1' to the '5' (making '6') and keep '0'. (8 + 2 = 10 -> 0, carry 1 to 5). So far: 23 6 0
    *   Keep '0' from '20'. So far: 23 6 0 0
    *   Add the '1' from '17' to the '0', making '1'. (0 + 1 = 1)
    *   Keep '7' from '17'. So far: 23 6 0 1 7

*   **Final Result:** 236017.

### Key Points:

*   The Addition Dot Method emphasizes mental calculation by reducing the need to hold carry-over digits in short-term memory.
*   It's a form of Vedic Mathematics, used in ancient times.
*   While traditional carry methods are also effective, practicing dot methods or other speed math techniques (like left-to-right addition, carry methods, or without-carry methods) can significantly improve calculation speed.
* I want you to extract the data from the following videos.

For you, this is an example I have extracted from previous videos, follow the same schema example : "
The user wants me to extract information about "ADDITION USING WITHOUT CARRYING METHOD" from the video.

## 19.Addition Using Without Carrying Method

This method focuses on performing addition by adding digits from left to right, without explicitly "carrying over" tens to the next column in the traditional way. Instead, the "carry" is visualized or mentally transferred to the next column's sum as a separate step. This approach is intended to increase mental math speed by breaking down the addition into simpler, independent steps.

**How it works:**

1.  **Add the leftmost digits:** Sum the digits in the leftmost column.
    *   If the sum is a single digit, note it.
    *   If the sum is a two-digit number, treat the tens digit as a "carry" to be added to the next column's sum, and the units digit as the result for the current position.

2.  **Move to the next column (to the right):** Sum the digits in the next column.
    *   If there was a "carry" from the previous column, add it to this sum.
    *   Again, if the new sum is a two-digit number, the tens digit becomes a "carry" for the next column, and the units digit is the result for the current position.

3.  **Repeat for all columns:** Continue this process from left to right for all digits.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 65 + 38**
    1.  **Leftmost digits (tens place):** $6 + 3 = 9$.
    2.  **Next digits (ones place):** $5 + 8 = 13$.
    3.  **Combine and adjust:** The '9' from the first step and '13' from the second step are visualized as '9' and '1' (from 13) in the tens place and '3' in the ones place. Adding the '1' to the '9' gives '10'.
    4.  **Result:** 103

*   **Example 2: 736 + 316**
    1.  **Leftmost digits (hundreds place):** $7 + 3 = 10$.
    2.  **Next digits (tens place):** $3 + 1 = 4$.
    3.  **Next digits (ones place):** $6 + 6 = 12$.
    4.  **Combine and adjust:** We have 10, 4, and 12.
        *   Take the '1' from '12' and add it to the '4', making it '5'. So now we have 10, 5, and 2.
        *   The '10' for the hundreds place, '5' for the tens place, and '2' for the ones place.
    5.  **Result:** 1052

*   **Example 3: 3282 + 2995**
    1.  **Leftmost digits (thousands place):** $3 + 2 = 5$.
    2.  **Next digits (hundreds place):** $2 + 9 = 11$.
    3.  **Next digits (tens place):** $8 + 9 = 17$.
    4.  **Next digits (ones place):** $2 + 5 = 7$.
    5.  **Combine and adjust:** We have 5, 11, 17, and 7.
        *   Take the '1' from '17' and add it to the '11', making it '12'. Now we have 5, 12, 7, and 7.
        *   Take the '1' from '12' and add it to the '5', making it '6'. Now we have 6, 2, 7, and 7.
    6.  **Result:** 6277

**Key Points:**

*   This method emphasizes **visualization** and **mental calculation** to improve speed.
*   It involves adding digits from **left to right**, which differs from the traditional right-to-left addition.
*   When a sum of a column results in a two-digit number, the tens digit is mentally carried and added to the *next* sum, not directly written down and carried over as in standard addition.
*   The speaker encourages **daily practice** to master this technique and reduce reliance on paper or calculators.
# *20. Ekadhikena purvena 
* The Sanskrit term "Ekadhikena Purvena" translates to "By one more than the previous one". This Vedic mathematics sutra (formula) offers a simplified approach to certain multiplication problems, enhancing calculation speed and accuracy.

### Applications of Ekadhikena Purvena

The Ekadhikena Purvena sutra is primarily used in two main multiplication scenarios:

#### 1. Squaring Numbers Ending in 5

This method provides a quick way to calculate the square of any number that ends with the digit 5.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the 'previous' digit:** Separate the last digit (which is always 5) from the digit(s) preceding it. This preceding part is considered the "previous" digit.
    *   *Example:* For $35 \times 35$, the 'previous' digit is 3.
    *   *Example:* For $65 \times 65$, the 'previous' digit is 6.
    *   *Example:* For $105 \times 105$, the 'previous' digit is 10.

2.  **Multiply the 'previous' digit by 'one more than the previous':** Take the 'previous' digit and multiply it by the number that is one greater than itself. This product forms the left-hand side of your answer.
    *   *Example:* For 35, 'one more than the previous' (3) is 4. So, $3 \times 4 = 12$.
    *   *Example:* For 65, 'one more than the previous' (6) is 7. So, $6 \times 7 = 42$.
    *   *Example:* For 105, 'one more than the previous' (10) is 11. So, $10 \times 11 = 110$.

3.  **Append '25' to the right:** The square of 5 is always 25. This forms the right-hand side of your answer.

4.  **Combine the results:** Place the result from step 2 and step 3 together to get the final answer.
    *   *Example:* $35 \times 35 = 1225$.
    *   *Example:* $65 \times 65 = 4225$.
    *   *Example:* $105 \times 105 = 11025$.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Problem:** $35 \times 35$
    *   'Previous' digit is 3. $3 \times (3+1) = 3 \times 4 = 12$.
    *   Append 25.
    *   **Result:** $1225$

*   **Problem:** $45 \times 45$
    *   'Previous' digit is 4. $4 \times (4+1) = 4 \times 5 = 20$.
    *   Append 25.
    *   **Result:** $2025$

*   **Problem:** $55 \times 55$
    *   'Previous' digit is 5. $5 \times (5+1) = 5 \times 6 = 30$.

#### 2. Multiplying Numbers with the Same First Digit(s) and Last Digit(s) Summing to a Power of 10

This method is applicable when the first digit(s) of two numbers are identical, and their last digit(s) sum up to 10, 100, 1000, or any other power of 10.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the common first digit(s) and the last digit(s):**
    *   *Example:* For $71 \times 79$, the common first digit is 7, and the last digits are 1 and 9.
    *   *Example:* For $24 \times 26$, the common first digit is 2, and the last digits are 4 and 6.
    *   *Example:* For $103 \times 107$, the common first digit(s) is 10, and the last digits are 3 and 7.

2.  **Verify the conditions:**
    *   The first digit(s) of both numbers must be the same.
    *   The sum of the last digit(s) must be a power of 10 (e.g., 10, 100, etc.).
    *   *Example:* $71 \times 79$: First digits are 7 (same). Last digits $1 + 9 = 10$.
    *   *Example:* $894 \times 806$: First digit is 8 (same). Last digits $94 + 06 = 100$.

3.  **Multiply the last digit(s):** Multiply the last digit(s) of both numbers. The number of digits in this product should match the power of 10 (e.g., two digits if the sum is 10, four digits if the sum is 100, etc.). If the product has fewer digits, prefix with zeros.
    *   *Example:* For $71 \times 79$, $1 \times 9 = 9$. Write as 09.
    *   *Example:* For $63 \times 67$, $3 \times 7 = 21$.

4.  **Multiply the common first digit(s) by 'one more':** Take the common first digit(s) and multiply it by the number that is one greater than itself. This forms the left-hand side of your answer.
    *   *Example:* For $71 \times 79$, the common first digit is 7. $7 \times (7+1) = 7 \times 8 = 56$.
    *   *Example:* For $63 \times 67$, the common first digit is 6. $6 \times (6+1) = 6 \times 7 = 42$.
    *   *Example:* For $103 \times 107$, the common first digit is 10. $10 \times (10+1) = 10 \times 11 = 110$.

5.  **Combine the results:** Concatenate the result from step 4 with the result from step 3.
    *   *Example:* $71 \times 79 = 5609$.
    *   *Example:* $63 \times 67 = 4221$.
    *   *Example:* $103 \times 107 = 11009$.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Problem:** $71 \times 79$
    *   Last digits: $1 \times 9 = 09$
    *   First digit: 7. $7 \times (7+1) = 7 \times 8 = 56$.
    *   **Result:** $5609$

*   **Problem:** $63 \times 67$
    *   Last digits: $3 \times 7 = 21$
    *   First digit: 6. $6 \times (6+1) = 6 \times 7 = 42$.
    *   **Result:** $4221$

*   **Problem:** $58 \times 52$
    *   Last digits: $8 \times 2 = 16$
    *   First digit: 5. $5 \times (5+1) = 5 \times 6 = 30$.
    *   **Result:** $3016$

**Advanced Examples (as per video's calculations):**

*   **Problem:** $191 \times 109$
    *   Last digits: $91 \times 09 = 819$.
    *   Preceding digit (of 191/109): 1. The video implicitly uses 10 as the "previous" number, then multiplies $10 \times (10+1) = 110$. For the given solution it seems to be taking the '1' from '191' and '109' and then multiplying the next digit by 10. So $1 \times 10$ and it's some interpretation that makes it 20.
    *   **Result (as shown in video):** $20819$

*   **Problem:** $894 \times 806$
    *   Last digits: $94 \times 06 = 564$.
    *   Preceding digit (of 894/806): 8. The video then multiplies $8 \times (8+1) = 72$ and then further multiplies by 10, resulting in 720.
    *   **Result (as shown in video):** $720564$

*   **Problem:** $311 \times 319$
    *   Last digits: $1 \times 9 = 09$.
    *   Preceding digit (of 311/319): 31. $31 \times (31+1) = 31 \times 32 = 992$.
    *   **Result (as shown in video):** $99209$

* ## 21.Beejank (Digital Root) for Easy Verification

Beejank, also known as the digital root, is a technique used for easy verification of calculations, particularly useful in competitive exams with multiple-choice questions. It involves reducing a number to a single digit by repeatedly adding its digits.

**Concept of Beejank:**

Beejank means "easy verification." When performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), the digital root of the numbers involved will have a specific relationship to the digital root of the answer. This relationship can be used to quickly check if a calculated answer is correct or to identify the correct option among multiple choices without performing the full calculation.

**How to calculate Beejank (Digital Root):**

To find the Beejank of a number, continuously add its digits until a single digit (from 1 to 9) is obtained. If the sum is 9, the Beejank is considered 9 (or 0 in some contexts, but for verification, 9 is often used directly).

**Examples from the video:**

    $7 + 8 = 15$
    $1 + 5 = 6$
    The Beejank of 78 is 6.

3.  **Perform the operation on the Beejanks:**
    $3 / 6$ (Since 3 cannot be directly divided by 6 to get an integer, we consider it as a fraction, and check if the Beejank of the answer matches). In this context, it implies checking the Beejank of the *result* of the division of the Beejanks.

4.  **Calculate Beejank of the answer (56):**
    $5 + 6 = 11$
    $1 + 1 = 2$
    The Beejank of 56 is 2.
    Here, the video demonstrates checking the relationship directly with the answer's Beejank. The initial Beejank division 3/6 leads to 0.5, which when its digits are added (5) doesn't directly correspond to 2. However, the explanation highlights that the "Beejank of the dividend divided by the Beejank of the divisor should equal the Beejank of the quotient". In cases where direct integer division of Beejanks isn't possible, it usually implies a more complex relationship, or it's simply stated that if the Beejanks of the dividend, divisor, and quotient work together in the original operation, the answer is correct. The video shows that if we treat 3/6 as 1/2, and then look for an answer with a Beejank of 2, it works out.

    The Beejank of the total population should be 7.

5.  **Check the Beejank of each option:**
    *   **A. 235860489:**
        $2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 0 + 4 + 8 + 9 = 45$
        $4 + 5 = 9$
        The Beejank is 9. This does not match.

    *(Self-correction based on video explanation for this question)* The video's calculation for the sum of Beejanks is $3+1+5=9$. Let's re-calculate the Beejank for the third population number from the video, as my calculation gave 3, while the video implies 5:
    45036237: $4+5+0+3+6+2+3+7 = 30 \rightarrow 3+0 = 3$. My calculation gives 3. The video states 5. This indicates a discrepancy in the video's manual calculation in that segment.

    Let's re-evaluate the sum of Beejanks with my accurate calculations:
    $3 + 1 + 3 = 7$. So, the target Beejank for the answer is 7.

    Now, let's re-check the options with the target Beejank of 7.
    *   **A. 235860489:** $2+3+5+8+6+0+4+8+9 = 45 \rightarrow 4+5 = 9$. Not 7.
    *   **B. 225860489:** $2+2+5+8+6+0+4+8+9 = 44 \rightarrow 4+4 = 8$. Not 7.
    *   **C. 225960489:** $2+2+5+9+6+0+4+8+9 = 45 \rightarrow 4+5 = 9$. Not 7.
    *   **D. 225960499:** $2+2+5+9+6+0+4+9+9 = 46 \rightarrow 4+6 = 10 \rightarrow 1+0 = 1$. Not 7.

    It seems there might be an error in the question or the provided options/solution within the video, as none of the options have a Beejank of 7. However, if we follow the video's *stated* Beejanks from the first pass of addition (3+1+5=9 for the question numbers, and 9 for option A), the video indicates A is the answer because its Beejank is 9. This suggests a potential miscalculation or simplification of the third number's Beejank in the video's explanation.

**Q.4) Length and Breadth of a rectangle are 74 cm and 56 cm respectively. Calculate the area of the rectangle.**
A. 4144

    $5 + 6 = 11$
    $1 + 1 = 2$
    The Beejank of 56 is 2.

4.  **Perform the operation on the Beejanks (multiplication):**
    $2 \times 2 = 4$
    The Beejank of the area should be 4.

5.  **Check the Beejank of each option:**
    *   **A. 4144:**
        $4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13$
        $1 + 3 = 4$
        The Beejank is 4. This matches.

    *   **B. 4244:**
        $4 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 14$
        $1 + 4 = 5$
        The Beejank is 5. This does not match.

    *   **C. 4044:**
        $4 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 12$
        $1 + 2 = 3$
        The Beejank is 3. This does not match.

    *   **D. 4344:**
        $4 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 15$
        $1 + 5 = 6$
        The Beejank is 6. This does not match.

    Therefore, Option A is the correct answer.

**Conclusion:**

The Beejank method allows for quick verification of calculations by comparing the digital roots of the operands and the result. This can be a valuable tool for competitive exams where time is a critical factor, helping to identify incorrect answers or confirm correct ones without extensive manual calculation.

Keywords: Vedic Maths, Ekadhikena Purvena, Multiplication, Squaring, Math Tricks, Fast Calculation
The "Ekadhikena Nyunena" multiplication trick is a Vedic mathematics technique primarily used for multiplying numbers by a series of nines (9, 99, 999, etc.). The name translates to "By one less than the previous one," which is a key principle of this method.

# 22.Ekadhikena Nyunena 

This method simplifies multiplication, especially when one of the numbers consists solely of nines. It is a specific application of Vedic math's broader "All from 9 and the Last from 10" (Nikhilam Navatasharamam Dasatha Sutra) and "By One More Than the Previous One" (Ekadhikena Purvena Sutra) principles.

**How it works:**

The trick involves two main steps to arrive at the final product, which is typically split into a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS).

1.  **Left-Hand Side (LHS) Calculation:** Subtract 1 from the multiplicand (the number being multiplied by the series of nines). This result forms the LHS of your answer.

2.  **Right-Hand Side (RHS) Calculation:** Find the complement of the original multiplicand.
    *   For the units digit of the multiplicand, subtract it from 10.
    *   For all other digits of the multiplicand (from right to left, excluding the units digit), subtract them from 9.
    *   These complementary digits, when combined in order, form the RHS of your answer.

**Conditions for application:**

This trick is most straightforward when the number of digits in the multiplicand is equal to the number of nines in the multiplier. If the number of digits in the multiplicand is less than the number of nines, you can prefix zeros to the multiplicand to make the digit counts equal.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 36 x 9**
    *   **LHS:** $36 - 1 = 35$
    *   **RHS:** $10 - 6 = 4$. This 4 is then combined with the other digit which is determined by subtracting the digit before the units digit (3) from 9: $9 - 3 = 6$. So the RHS is 64. However, the video shows a simplified form for single 9 multiplication where 36 - 1 = 35 (LHS) and $10 - 6 = 4$ (RHS). Then, a subtraction from 36 with an implied 'next digit' (which is effectively 1 more than the tens digit) is performed to get the full answer. Let's follow the general rule: $36 - 1 = 35$. Now, for the complement, we consider $36$ subtracted from a base of $100$ where $9$s complement rule applies: $9-3=6$, $10-6=4$. The result shown in the video is $324$, which implies that the first part of the answer is $36- (10-6) = 36-4=32$.
    *   **Result (following the video's demonstrated method for single-digit multiplier):**
        *   $10 - 6 = 4$ (RHS digit).
        *   $36 - ( \text{digit before 6} + 1) = 36 - (3+1) = 36 - 4 = 32$ (LHS digits).
        *   **Final Answer:** 324.

*   **Example 2: 45 x 9**
    *   **Result (following the video's demonstrated method for single-digit multiplier):**
        *   $10 - 5 = 5$ (RHS digit).
        *   $45 - ( \text{digit before 5} + 1) = 45 - (4+1) = 45 - 5 = 40$ (LHS digits).
        *   **Final Answer:** 405.

*   **Example 3: 84 x 9**
    *   **Result (following the video's demonstrated method for single-digit multiplier):**
        *   $10 - 4 = 6$ (RHS digit).
        *   $84 - ( \text{digit before 4} + 1) = 84 - (8+1) = 84 - 9 = 75$ (LHS digits).
        *   **Final Answer:** 756.

*   **Example 4: 57 x 99**
    *   **LHS:** $57 - 1 = 56$
    *   **RHS:**
        *   $10 - 7 = 3$

## 26.Prime Numbers

Prime numbers are fundamental in mathematics. They are defined as natural numbers greater than 1 that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself.

**How to Identify a Prime Number:**
To determine if a number is prime, you need to find its factors (numbers that divide into it evenly).
*   If a number has exactly two factors (1 and itself), it is a prime number.
*   If a number has more than two factors, it is a composite number.

**Examples:**
*   **1:** Has only one factor (1). Therefore, 1 is **not** a prime number.
*   **2:** Has factors 1 and 2. It has exactly two factors, so 2 **is** a prime number.
*   **3:** Has factors 1 and 3. It has exactly two factors, so 3 **is** a prime number.
*   **4:** Has factors 1, 2, and 4. It has more than two factors, so 4 is **not** a prime number.
*   **5:** Has factors 1 and 5. It has exactly two factors, so 5 **is** a prime number.
*   **6:** Has factors 1, 2, 3, and 6. It has more than two factors, so 6 is **not** a prime number.
*   **7:** Has factors 1 and 7. It has exactly two factors, so 7 **is** a prime number.

**Key Facts about Prime Numbers:**
*   **Number 1:** The number 1 is neither a prime number nor a composite number because it only has one factor.
*   **Smallest Prime Number:** The smallest prime number is 2. It is also the only even prime number, as all other even numbers are divisible by 2.
*   **Smallest Odd Prime Number:** The smallest odd prime number is 3.
*   **Prime Numbers from 1 to 100:** There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100. These are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

**Keywords:** Prime Number, Factors, Smallest Prime, Smallest Odd Prime, Prime Numbers 1 to 100, Composite Number, Divisors.
## 27.Tally System

Tally marks, also known as hash marks, are a form of numeral used for counting. They can be thought of as a unary numeral system. They are frequently employed in various contexts, such as keeping scores in sports or games, or marking points in quizzes.

### Representing Numbers with Tally Marks

*   **Numbers 1-4:** Each unit is represented by a single vertical line.
    *   1: |
    *   2: ||
    *   3: |||
    *   4: ||||

*   **Clustering (for 5 and above):** To enhance readability and simplify counting for larger numbers, tally marks are grouped into clusters of five. This is achieved by drawing four vertical lines and then a fifth diagonal line across them.
    *   5: <s>||||</s>
    *   For numbers exceeding five, additional clusters of five are created, followed by individual vertical lines for any remaining units.
    *   Example: 30 would be represented by six clusters of five: <s>||||</s> <s>||||</s> <s>||||</s> <s>||||</s> <s>||||</s> <s>||||</s>

### Key Points

*   **Purpose:** Tally marks are primarily used for counting and representing quantities in a simple, visual manner.
*   **Unary Numeral System:** The tally system is considered a unary numeral system because each increment is represented by adding a single mark.
*   **Clustering for Efficiency:** The practice of "clustering" or "bundling" marks, typically in groups of five, improves the speed and accuracy of counting, especially for larger quantities.
*   **Common Applications:** Tally marks are commonly used in informal settings like scoring games, quizzes, or conducting quick surveys.
* ## 28.Co-prime Numbers

**Definition:**
Co-prime numbers (also known as relatively prime numbers or mutually prime numbers) are a set of integers where the only common positive divisor is 1. This means their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.

**How to identify co-prime numbers:**

1.  **List the factors:** For each number in the set, list all its factors.
2.  **Find common factors:** Identify the factors that are common to all numbers in the set.
3.  **Check for '1':** If the only common factor among all numbers is 1, then the numbers are co-prime.

**Examples from the video:**

*   **Example 1: 4 and 7**
    *   Factors of 4: 1, 2, 4
    *   Factors of 7: 1, 7
    *   Common factor: 1
    *   **Conclusion:** 4 and 7 are co-prime numbers.

*   **Example 2: 5, 7, and 9**
    *   Factors of 5: 1, 5
    *   Factors of 7: 1, 7
    *   Factors of 9: 1, 3, 9
    *   Common factor: 1
    *   **Conclusion:** 5, 7, and 9 are co-prime numbers.

**Key Points:**

*   A set of numbers can be co-prime even if individual numbers within the set are not prime. For instance, 4 and 9 are not prime numbers, but they are co-prime because their only common factor is 1.
*   The concept of co-prime numbers is fundamental in number theory and has applications in various mathematical fields, including cryptography.
* The video explains the concept of frequency and then presents two examples of how to create a frequency distribution table using tally marks. Finally, it provides another example where the highest frequency is identified directly from a given dataset.

## 29.Frequency

Frequency ($f$) of a particular value is the number of times the value occurs in the data. In Malayalam, frequency is called "ആവൃത്തി" (aavr̥tti), which means repetition.

For a given dataset with multiple values, the frequency of a specific value indicates how many times that value appears in the dataset. For example, if the number 5 appears three times in a dataset of 10 numbers, then the frequency of 5 is 3.

Frequency can be represented using tally marks. For instance, if the frequency is 3, it can be represented as "|||". If the frequency is 5, it can be represented as "<s>||||</s>" (four vertical lines with a diagonal line through them).

### Example 1: Blood Donation Camp Data

An office complex conducted a blood donation camp, and the blood groups of 25 employees were recorded. The task is to represent this data in a frequency distribution table using tally marks.

**Blood Groups Data:**
A+, B-, O+, AB-, O-, A+, O-, B-, A+, O+, O+, A-, AB-, O-, A+, AB-, O-, AB+, B+, A-, O+, A+

**Frequency Distribution Table:**

| Blood Group | Frequency | Tally Marks |
| :---------- | :-------- | :---------- |
| A+          | 4         | ||||        |
| B-          | 2         | ||          |
| O-          | 3         | |||         |
| AB-         | 3         | |||         |
| O+          | 5         | <s>||||</s>        |
| AB+         | 0         |             |
| B+          | 2         | ||          |
| A-          | 4         | ||||        |

**Analysis of the data:**
*   The highest frequency is 5, which corresponds to the blood group O+.
*   The least frequency is 0, which corresponds to the blood group AB+.

### Example 2: Age Groups of Students

The following are the age groups of 20 students in a class:
5, 12, 15, 13, 8, 9, 3, 7, 16, 18, 11, 14, 8, 7, 3, 16, 17, 12, 4, 9.

To create a frequency distribution table, especially when there are many data points, it's often useful to group the data into intervals. This makes the table more manageable and easier to interpret. These groups are called "intervals" or "class intervals".

**Frequency Distribution Table with Class Intervals:**

| Class Interval | Frequency | Tally Marks |
| :------------- | :-------- | :---------- |
| 1-3            | 2         | ||          |
| 4-6            | 2         | ||          |
| 7-9            | 6         | <s>||||</s>|       |
| 10-12          | 3         | |||         |
| 13-15          | 3         | |||         |
| 16-18          | 4         | ||||        |

**Analysis of the data:**
*   The sum of the frequencies is 20, which matches the total number of students.
*   The highest frequency is 6, which corresponds to the class interval 7-9.
*   The least frequency is 2, which corresponds to the class intervals 1-3 and 4-6.

### Example 3: Weekly Allowance of Workers

The weekly allowance of a group of 20 workers is given below. The task is to identify which allowance has the highest frequency.

**Weekly Allowance Data:**
400, 370, 400, 250, 450, 500, 350, 150, 400, 260, 300, 400, 300, 150, 250, 400, 200, 500, 400.

**Frequency Count for each Allowance:**

*   400: 7 times
*   370: 1 time
*   250: 2 times
*   450: 1 time
*   500: 2 times
*   350: 1 time
*   150: 2 times
*   260: 1 time
*   300: 2 times
*   200: 1 time

**Conclusion:**
By counting the occurrences of each allowance, it is clear that 400 has the highest frequency of 7.

## 30.Time Measurement and Conversions

This video discusses various units of time measurement and their conversions, including standard units and how time relates to angular displacement in a clock.

**Key Time Conversions:**

The following are fundamental time conversions:

*   **1 minute (min)** = 60 seconds (s)
*   **1 hour (hr)** = 60 minutes
*   **1 hour (hr)** = 3600 seconds (since 60 minutes \* 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds)
*   **1 day** = 24 hours
*   **1 day** = 1440 minutes (since 24 hours \* 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes)
*   **1 day** = 86,400 seconds (since 1440 minutes \* 60 seconds/minute = 86,400 seconds)
*   **1 week** = 7 days
*   **1 week** = 168 hours (since 7 days \* 24 hours/day = 168 hours)
*   **1 month** ≈ 30 days (February has 28 or 29 days, other months have 30 or 31 days)
*   **1 month** ≈ 4 weeks
*   **1 year** = 365 days (366 days in a leap year)
*   **1 year** = 12 months
*   **1 year** = 52 weeks
*   **1 decade** = 10 years
*   **1 century** = 100 years
*   **1 millennium** = 1000 years

**Detailed Breakdown of a Day:**

While commonly stated as 24 hours, a precise day is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds.

**Time and Angular Measurement (Clock Analogy):**

A clock face is a circle, which has 360 degrees.

*   **60 minutes** corresponds to a full circle, or 360 degrees.
*   Therefore, **1 minute** = $\frac{360 \text{ degrees}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 6 \text{ degrees}$ per minute.
*   **1 hour** (when considering the hour hand's movement relative to the minute hand completing a full circle) is also equivalent to 360 degrees of rotation for the minute hand.
*   **1 second** = $\frac{1}{10}$ degrees (This is derived from 1 minute = 6 degrees, and 1 minute = 60 seconds, so 1 second = $\frac{6 \text{ degrees}}{60 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ degrees per second}$).

These angular conversions are important for solving problems involving the relative positions of clock hands, such as when they coincide or the angle they form at a specific time.

**Other Time Period Terminology:**

*   **Fortnight:** A period of two weeks.
*   **Quarter:** A period of three months.
*   **Half-year:** A period of six months.
*   **Time of Day Names:**
    *   **Dawn:** The first appearance of light in the sky before sunrise.
    *   **Morning:** The period from sunrise to noon.
    *   **Noon:** 12:00 PM (midday).
    *   **Afternoon:** The period from noon to evening.
    *   **Dusk:** The time of day when the sky is dark but there is still some light from the sun below the horizon.
    *   **Evening:** The period of the day between afternoon and night.
    *   **Night:** The period of darkness in each twenty-four hours.
    *   **Midnight:** 12:00 AM (middle of the night).
    * The user is asking to extract information about number systems from the video. The video discusses the Indian and International number systems, focusing on the number of zeros associated with each named value (e.g., Tens, Hundreds, Lakhs, Millions, Billions, etc.). It also touches upon conversions between different magnitudes within a system (e.g., how many tens are in a thousand).

Here's a breakdown of the key information presented:

The video explains two primary number systems: the Indian Number System and the International Number System. It emphasizes understanding the number of zeros associated with each named value and how to perform conversions between them.

### Indian Number System

The Indian Number System has specific names for large numbers, and the video outlines the number of zeros for each:

*   **Units:** 1 (0 zeros)
*   **Tens:** 10 (1 zero)
*   **Hundreds:** 100 (2 zeros)
*   **Thousands:** 1,000 (3 zeros)
*   **Ten Thousand:** 10,000 (4 zeros)
*   **Lakhs:** 1,00,000 (5 zeros)
*   **Ten Lakhs:** 10,00,000 (6 zeros)
*   **Crores:** 1,00,00,000 (7 zeros)
*   **Ten Crores:** 10,00,00,000 (8 zeros)
*   **Arab:** 1,00,00,00,000 (9 zeros)
*   **Ten Arab:** 10,00,00,00,000 (10 zeros)
*   **Kharab:** 1,00,00,00,00,000 (11 zeros)
*   **Ten Kharab:** 10,00,00,00,00,000 (12 zeros)
*   **Neel:** 1,00,00,00,00,00,000 (13 zeros)
*   **Ten Neel:** 10,00,00,00,00,00,000 (14 zeros)
*   **Padma:** 1,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 (15 zeros)
*   **Ten Padma:** 10,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 (16 zeros)
*   **Shankh:** 1,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 (17 zeros)
*   **Ten Shankh:** 10,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 (18 zeros)
*   **Maha-shankh:** 1,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,000 (19 zeros, which translates to a 20-digit number with the leading '1').

### International Number System

The International Number System uses a different set of terms for large numbers, based on powers of ten. The video highlights the powers of ten (number of zeros) for each:

*   **Ones:** 1 ($10^0$)
*   **Tens:** 10 ($10^1$)
*   **Hundreds:** 100 ($10^2$)
*   **Thousands:** 1,000 ($10^3$)
*   **Ten Thousands:** 10,000 ($10^4$)
*   **Hundred Thousands:** 100,000 ($10^5$)
*   **Millions:** 1,000,000 ($10^6$)
*   **Ten Millions:** 10,000,000 ($10^7$)
*   **Hundred Millions:** 100,000,000 ($10^8$)
*   **Billions:** 1,000,000,000 ($10^9$)
*   **Ten Billions:** 10,000,000,000 ($10^{10}$)
*   **Hundred Billions:** 100,000,000,000 ($10^{11}$)
*   **Trillions:** 1,000,000,000,000 ($10^{12}$)
*   **Ten Trillions:** 10,000,000,000,000 ($10^{13}$)
*   **Hundred Trillions:** 100,000,000,000,000 ($10^{14}$)
*   **Quadrillions:** 1,000,000,000,000,000 ($10^{15}$)
*   **Ten Quadrillions:** 10,000,000,000,000,000 ($10^{16}$)
*   **Hundred Quadrillions:** 100,000,000,000,000,000 ($10^{17}$)
*   **Quintillions:** 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 ($10^{18}$)
*   **Ten Quintillions:** 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 ($10^{19}$)
*   **Hundred Quintillions:** 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 ($10^{20}$)

### Conversions Between Number Systems

The video demonstrates how to convert between different magnitudes and systems by understanding the number of zeros.

*   **To find how many "tens" are in a "thousand"**: Divide the value of "thousand" by the value of "tens" (1000 / 10 = 100). Alternatively, count the zeros in "thousand" (3) and subtract the zeros in "tens" (1), resulting in 2 zeros, meaning 100.
*   **To find how many "thousands" are in a "crore"**: A crore has 7 zeros (1,00,00,000), and a thousand has 3 zeros (1,000). Removing 3 zeros from a crore leaves 4 zeros (10,000), meaning there are 10,000 thousands in a crore.
*   **To find how many "tens" are in a "lakh"**: A lakh has 5 zeros (1,00,000), and a ten has 1 zero (10). Removing 1 zero from a lakh leaves 4 zeros (10,000), meaning there are 10,000 tens in a lakh.
*   **To find how many "thousands" are in a "lakh"**: A lakh has 5 zeros (1,00,000), and a thousand has 3 zeros (1,000). Removing 3 zeros from a lakh leaves 2 zeros (100), meaning there are 100 thousands in a lakh.

### Equivalencies between Indian and International Systems

The video also implicitly highlights equivalencies between the two systems:

*   **Hundred Thousand** (International) is equivalent to **Lakh** (Indian).
*   **Million** (International) is equivalent to **Ten Lakhs** (Indian).
*   **Ten Million** (International) is equivalent to **Crore** (Indian).
*   **Hundred Million** (International) is equivalent to **Ten Crores** (Indian).
*   **Billion** (International) is equivalent to **Arab** (Indian).
*   **Ten Billion** (International) is equivalent to **Ten Arab** (Indian).
*   **Hundred Billion** (International) is equivalent to **Kharab** (Indian).
*   **Trillion** (International) is equivalent to **Ten Kharab** (Indian).
*   **Ten Trillion** (International) is equivalent to **Neel** (Indian).
*   **Hundred Trillion** (International) is equivalent to **Ten Neel** (Indian).
*   **Quadrillion** (International) is equivalent to **Padma** (Indian).
*   **Ten Quadrillion** (International) is equivalent to **Ten Padma** (Indian).
*   **Hundred Quadrillion** (International) is equivalent to **Shankh** (Indian).
*   **Quintillion** (International) is equivalent to **Ten Shankh** (Indian).
*   **Ten Quintillion** (International) is equivalent to **Maha-shankh** (Indian).

To perform conversions between these systems, one needs to equate the number of zeros. For example, to convert **Billion** to the Indian system, one would look at the number of zeros in a Billion (9 zeros, $10^9$) and find the corresponding Indian term, which is Arab (9 zeros). Similarly, 10 crores (8 zeros) is equivalent to 100 million (8 zeros).
This video explains a shortcut for reading large numbers using the Indian numbering system.

Reading a number
**How it works:**

1.  **Count the total number of digits in the given number.**
2.  **Subtract 7 from the total number of digits.** The result determines the number of digits that will be read as "crores" (or the largest unit).
    *   For example, if the total number of digits is 11, then $11 - 7 = 4$. This means the first four digits will be read in "crores."
    *   If the total number of digits is 9, then $9 - 7 = 2$. This means the first two digits will be read in "crores."
    *   If the total number of digits is 10, then $10 - 7 = 3$. This means the first three digits will be read in "crores."
3.  **From the starting digit, group the number of digits obtained in step 2.** This will be your "crores" portion.
4.  **After the "crores" portion, group the remaining digits in pairs (two digits each) from left to right.**
    *   The first pair after "crores" will be read in "lakhs."
    *   The second pair after "crores" will be read in "thousands."
    *   The remaining three digits will be read in "hundreds" (standard number reading).

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Number: 25796565676
    *   Total digits: 11
    *   Subtract 7: $11 - 7 = 4$
    *   First 4 digits: 2579 (will be "crores")
    *   Next 2 digits: 65 (will be "lakhs")
    *   Next 2 digits: 65 (will be "thousands")
    *   Remaining 3 digits: 676 (will be "hundreds")
    *   **Result:** Two thousand five hundred seventy-nine crores, sixty-five lakhs, sixty-five thousand, six hundred seventy-six.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Number: 325431589
    *   Total digits: 9
    *   Subtract 7: $9 - 7 = 2$
    *   First 2 digits: 32 (will be "crores")
    *   Next 2 digits: 54 (will be "lakhs")
    *   Next 2 digits: 31 (will be "thousands")
    *   Remaining 3 digits: 589 (will be "hundreds")
    *   **Result:** Thirty-two crores, fifty-four lakhs, thirty-one thousand, five hundred eighty-nine.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Number: 5271437658
    *   Total digits: 10
    *   Subtract 7: $10 - 7 = 3$
    *   First 3 digits: 527 (will be "crores")
    *   Next 2 digits: 14 (will be "lakhs")
    *   Next 2 digits: 37 (will be "thousands")
    *   Remaining 3 digits: 658 (will be "hundreds")
    *   **Result:** Five hundred twenty-seven crores, fourteen lakhs, thirty-seven thousand, six hundred fifty-eight.

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is specifically designed for the Indian numbering system, which uses units like lakhs and crores.
*   The system uses groups of two digits after the initial "crores" section, unlike the international system which uses groups of three digits.
*   The subtraction of 7 helps in quickly identifying the highest place value (crores) for larger numbers.

### **32.Open and Closed Figures**
* In geometry, figures can be classified as either open or closed. This classification depends on whether their starting and ending points meet.

### Open Figures
Open shapes are defined as shapes or figures that have different starting and ending points. In other words, the ends of an open shape do not meet.

**Characteristics of Open Figures:**
*   They have distinct starting and ending points.
*   Their ends are not connected.
*   They do not enclose a space completely.
*   They do not have a fixed area or a well-defined interior and exterior region.
*   They do not have a perimeter.

**Examples of Open Figures:**
*   Line segments
*   Rays
*   Arcs
*   Semicircles
*   Various letters of the alphabet, such as C, M, U, W, N, L, S.
*   Zigzag lines
*   Spirals

### Closed Figures
Closed figures are shapes or figures where there are no open endings. They are defined as shapes where their line segments and/or curves are connected, and they have the same starting and ending point. This means you can trace the entire figure with a pencil and return to the starting point without lifting the pencil.

**Characteristics of Closed Figures:**
*   They have the same starting and ending points.
*   Their line segments or curves are connected and form a complete boundary.
*   They enclose a space, having a well-defined interior and exterior region.
*   They have a definite area and perimeter.

**Examples of Closed Figures:**
*   Circles
*   Ovals/Ellipses
*   Triangles
*   Squares
*   Rectangles
*   Pentagons
*   Hexagons
*   Octagons
*   Rhombuses
*   Trapezoids/Trapeziums
*   Stars
*   Various letters of the English alphabet, such as B, D, O.

### Polygons
Polygons are a specific type of closed figure. They are defined as two-dimensional closed shapes formed by joining three or more straight-line segments. The line segments are called sides or edges, and the points where they meet are called vertices or corners. Circles and ellipses are closed figures but are not polygons because they have curved sides, not straight-line segments.

The user has provided a video on "Embedded Images" by IQED. This video discusses non-verbal reasoning problems where a hidden image needs to be identified within a larger figure. The speaker provides examples and solutions.

Here's the extracted data in the requested format:

## 33.Embedded Images

**Concept:**

Embedded Images (also known as Hidden Images) are a type of non-verbal reasoning question. The objective is to identify a given figure (figure X) hidden as a part within one of the alternative figures provided.

**How it works:**

1.  A "figure (X)" is presented, which is the image to be found.
2.  Several "alternative figures" (options 1, 2, 3, 4) are provided.
3.  The task is to find which of the alternative figures contains figure (X) as an embedded part.
4.  To solve these problems, one must carefully observe the lines and patterns of figure (X) and try to visually trace them within each alternative figure. This often involves "drawing" the lines of figure (X) mentally or with a pencil onto the alternative figures to see if it fits.
5.  Attention should be paid to details like the width of lines, angles, and specific features of the figure, as slight differences can indicate an incorrect match.
6.  The correct alternative figure is the one where the original figure (X) can be perfectly superimposed or traced without any missing or extra lines, or alterations to its shape.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Problem:** Find out the alternative figure which contains figure (X) as its part. (Figure X is a stylized 'M' or 'W' shape).
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker demonstrates drawing the shape within each option. Options 2 and 3 are eliminated because their lines do not match the angles or connections of figure (X). Option 4 is also incorrect due to a missing connection. Option 1 correctly embeds figure (X).
    *   **Result:** Option (1) is the correct answer.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Problem:** Find out the alternative figure which contains figure (X) as its part. (Figure X is a complex 'L' shape with varying widths).
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker highlights the varying width of the lines in figure (X). Options 1, 2, and 3 are dismissed because they don't have the correct shape or the varying width feature. Option 4 is identified as the correct match, as the embedded figure is visible.
    *   **Result:** Option (4) is the correct answer.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Problem:** Find out the alternative figure which contains figure (X) as its part. (Figure X is an arrowhead-like shape).
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker visually checks each option. Options 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect as the shape does not fit or its proportions are wrong. Option 4 is identified as containing the embedded image.
    *   **Result:** Option (4) is the correct answer.

*   **Example 4:**
    *   **Problem:** Find out the alternative figure which contains figure (X) as its part. (Figure X resembles a Swastika symbol).
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker quickly rules out options 1, 2, and 4 due to misaligned or incomplete features. Option 3 is shown to contain the embedded figure.
    *   **Result:** Option (3) is the correct answer.

*   **Example 5:**
    *   **Problem:** Find out the alternative figure which contains figure (X) as its part. (Figure X is a wavy, bent line).
    *   **Analysis:** The speaker quickly identifies the hidden image in option 4, tracing the lines in the figure that matches figure X's shape.
    *   **Result:** Option (4) is the correct answer.

**Key Points:**

*   Embedded Images questions require strong visual perception and spatial reasoning skills.
*   Practice is crucial for developing the ability to quickly identify hidden figures within complex patterns.
*   These types of questions are commonly found in various competitive exams and olympiads.
* The provided video is a tutorial on "Water Images" in logical reasoning, not an integration trick in mathematics. The speaker explains how to find the water image of a given figure or word. The core concept is that a water image is essentially the reflection of an object in a horizontal mirror (assumed to be along the XY axis, i.e., at the bottom).

Here's a breakdown of the content presented in the video:

## 34.Water Images (Logical Reasoning)

Water images are a type of mirror image where the mirror is placed horizontally, typically at the bottom of the object or figure. This means the top and bottom parts of the object are inverted, while the left and right sides remain the same.

**Key Concept:**

*   In a water image, the reflection occurs along the **South direction** (if considering directions like North, South, East, West).
*   The top portion of the object becomes the bottom, and the bottom becomes the top.
*   The left and right orientations remain unchanged.

**Practical Method (as demonstrated in the video):**

The speaker suggests a simple and effective method for finding water images, especially useful during exams:

1.  **Draw the figure/word:** On a rough paper, carefully draw or write the given figure or word.
2.  **Flip the paper:** To visualize the water image, flip the paper **vertically upwards** (or downwards). This simulates the reflection across a horizontal line.
3.  **Observe the inverted image:** The image you see on the other side of the paper after flipping is the water image.
4.  **Compare with options:** Match this observed image with the given answer figures or alternatives.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

The video demonstrates three examples: two involving figures and one involving a word.

*   **Example 1 (Figure):**
    *   **Question Figure:** A square with two diagonal arrows pointing downwards and to the right, and a wavy line (representing water) below.
    *   **Applying the method:** The speaker draws the figure and flips the paper vertically.
    *   **Result:** The water image shows the arrows pointing upwards and to the right, with the filled part still at the bottom of the arrow. The wavy line remains at the top.
    *   **Answer:** Option (1) is the correct water image.

*   **Example 2 (Figure):**
    *   **Question Figure:** A triangular shape with horizontal lines in the upper part and a small square in the bottom right corner, with a wavy line below.
    *   **Applying the method:** The speaker draws the figure and flips the paper vertically.
    *   **Result:** The water image shows the triangle inverted, the horizontal lines now in the lower part, and the small square in the top right corner.
    *   **Answer:** Option (4) is the correct water image.

*   **Example 3 (Word): NUCLEAR**
    *   **Question Word:** NUCLEAR
    *   **Applying the method:** The speaker writes "NUCLEAR" and flips the paper vertically.
    *   **Result:** The water image of "NUCLEAR" is a vertically inverted version of each letter.
    *   **Answer:** Option (4) (ИОСГЕ∀R) is the correct water image.

*   **Example 4 (Word): BRIDGE**
    *   **Question Word:** bridge
    *   **Applying the method:** The speaker writes "bridge" and flips the paper vertically.
    *   **Result:** The water image of "bridge" is a vertically inverted version of each letter.
    *   **Answer:** Option (2) (pq!qde) is the correct water image.

*   **Example 5 (Alphanumeric Combination): GR98APT6ES**
    *   **Question Combination:** GR98APT6ES
    *   **Applying the method:** The speaker writes the combination and flips the paper vertically.
    *   **Result:** The water image is a vertically inverted version of each character.
    *   **Answer:** Option (3) is the correct water image.

**Key Takeaway:**

The most straightforward way to solve water image problems is to physically draw the object and flip the paper vertically to see its reflection. This minimizes errors that can arise from mental rotations or complex rules for each character/shape.
## 35.Range (Statistics)

Range is a measure of variability in a dataset. It is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.

**Formula:**
Range = Maximum Value - Minimum Value

The range provides statisticians with a better understanding of how varied the data set is.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: CNG/LPG Prices**
    *   **Problem:** Aji's family drove through 6 North Indian states during their summer vacation. CNG prices varied from state to state. What is the range of LPG prices?
    *   **Dataset:** Rs. 756, Rs. 771, Rs. 796, Rs. 792, Rs. 784, Rs. 775
    *   **Maximum Value:** 796
    *   **Minimum Value:** 756
    *   **Range:** 796 - 756 = 40

*   **Example 2: Exam Scores**
    *   **Problem:** Consider the following dataset of exam scores for a class tenth: 63, 89, 92, 77, 72, 91, 82. Find the Range of the above data.
    *   **Dataset:** 63, 89, 92, 77, 72, 91, 82
    *   **Maximum Value:** 92
    *   **Minimum Value:** 63
    *   **Range:** 92 - 63 = 29
    * ## 36.Tables in Data Handling

This video explains how to interpret and extract information from frequency distribution tables, focusing on class intervals and frequencies.

**I. What is the size of the class intervals?**

The size of a class interval is the difference between its upper limit and its lower limit. For example, in a class interval of 0-5, the lower limit is 0 and the upper limit is 5. The size would be 5 - 0 = 5. All class intervals in a given table should have the same size.
*   In the provided table, the class intervals are:
    *   $0-5$: Size = $5 - 0 = 5$
    *   $5-10$: Size = $10 - 5 = 5$
    *   $10-15$: Size = $15 - 10 = 5$
    *   $15-20$: Size = $20 - 15 = 5$
    *   $20-25$: Size = $25 - 20 = 5$
    *   $25-30$: Size = $30 - 25 = 5$
    *   $30-35$: Size = $35 - 30 = 5$
    *   $35-40$: Size = $40 - 35 = 5$

In this specific table, all class intervals have a consistent size of 5.

**II. Which class interval has the highest frequency?**

The frequency column in a table shows how many data points fall within each class interval. To find the class interval with the highest frequency, you need to identify the largest value in the "Frequency" column.
*   In the given table, the highest frequency is 50.
*   The class interval corresponding to this frequency is $30-35$.

Therefore, the class interval $30-35$ has the highest frequency.

**III. Which two classes have the same frequency?**

To identify classes with the same frequency, you need to look for identical values in the "Frequency" column and then identify their corresponding class intervals.
*   A frequency of 2 is observed for two class intervals: $0-5$ and $15-20$.
*   A frequency of 10 is observed for two other class intervals: $10-15$ and $25-30$.

Therefore, the class intervals $0-5$ and $15-20$ have the same frequency (2), and the class intervals $10-15$ and $25-30$ also have the same frequency (10).

**IV. How many students have height less than 36 cm?**

To determine the number of students with a height less than 36 cm, sum the frequencies of all class intervals whose upper limit is less than 36 cm. Since the class intervals are in increments of 5, a height less than 36 cm implies considering all heights up to and including 35 cm.
*   The relevant class intervals and their frequencies are:
    *   $0-5$: Frequency = 2
    *   $5-10$: Frequency = 5
    *   $10-15$: Frequency = 10
    *   $15-20$: Frequency = 2
    *   $20-25$: Frequency = 20
    *   $25-30$: Frequency = 10
    *   $30-35$: Frequency = 50
*   Sum of frequencies: $2 + 5 + 10 + 2 + 20 + 10 + 50 = 99$.

Therefore, 99 students have a height less than 36 cm.

**V. What is the lower limit of the class interval 20-25?**

In a class interval expressed as "lower limit - upper limit," the lower limit is the starting value of the interval.
*   For the class interval $20-25$:
    *   The lower limit is 20.
    *   The upper limit is 25.

The user is asking for the extraction of data from the video. Based on the video, the user is looking for a summary of the key concepts discussed, including definitions, characteristics, and examples of 2D and 3D shapes.

Here's the extracted information:

## 37.2D Shapes: Names and Features

This video discusses two-dimensional (2D) shapes, their features, and examples of real-life objects that represent them.

### What are 2D Shapes?

A 2D (two-dimensional) shape is defined as a plane figure that can be drawn on a flat surface.

### Key Features of 2D Shapes:

*   **Dimensions:** A 2D shape has only two dimensions: length and width. It has no thickness or depth.
*   **Measurements:** 2D shapes have a perimeter (or circumference for circles) and an area. They do not have volume, as volume is a characteristic of 3D shapes.
*   **Drawability:** They can be drawn on a flat surface like a piece of paper or a blackboard.

### Basic 2D Shapes Mentioned:

The video lists several basic 2D shapes:
*   Circle
*   Square
*   Triangle
*   Rectangle
*   Oval
*   Diamond
*   Pentagon
*   Hexagon
*   Octagon
*   Semi-Circle
*   Star
*   Heart

### Examples of Real-Life Objects as 2D Shapes:

The video provides examples of common objects and their corresponding 2D shapes:
*   **Clock:** Circle or Square
*   **Window:** Square or Rectangle
*   **Television:** Rectangle
*   **Plate:** Circle (Plates can also come in other 2D shapes like rectangles, hexagons, or pentagons).

### Distinction between 2D and 3D Shapes:

The key difference highlighted is that 2D shapes have only length and width, while 3D shapes have length, width, and an additional dimension of thickness or depth. This third dimension in 3D shapes allows for the calculation of volume, which is not applicable to 2D shapes. For example, a rectangle is a 2D shape, but by adding depth, it becomes a 3D shape like a rectangular prism (cuboid).

### Importance of Understanding 2D Shapes:

Understanding 2D shapes and their properties is crucial for:
*   **Identifying odd ones out:** In tests or quizzes, knowing the characteristics of 2D shapes helps distinguish them from 3D shapes (e.g., a cone is 3D, while a circle, square, and triangle are 2D).
*   **Basic knowledge:** It forms a fundamental understanding of geometric concepts, including perimeter and area, which are essential in mathematics.
* ## 38.Angles

An angle is formed by two rays or lines that share a common endpoint. These rays or lines are called the arms of the angle.

### Types of Angles

There are several types of angles, categorized by their measurement:

*   **Zero Degree Angle:** An angle equal to 0 degrees, or one that has not turned, is called a zero angle. This can be represented as a single point.
*   **Acute Angle:** An angle smaller than a right angle (less than 90 degrees) is called an acute angle. The word "acute" means "sharp".
*   **Right Angle:** An angle equal to 90 degrees or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians is called a right angle. Two lines that form a right angle are said to be normal, orthogonal, or perpendicular.
*   **Obtuse Angle:** An angle larger than a right angle but smaller than a straight angle (between 90 and 180 degrees) is called an obtuse angle. The word "obtuse" means "blunt".
*   **Straight Angle:** An angle equal to 180 degrees or $\pi$ radians is called a straight angle. A straight line forms a straight angle.
*   **Reflex Angle:** An angle larger than a straight angle but less than a full turn (between 180 and 360 degrees) is called a reflex angle.
*   **Full Rotation Angle (or Complete Angle):** An angle equal to 1 turn (360 degrees or $2\pi$ radians) is called a full angle, complete angle, round angle, or perigon. This represents a full circle.

### Angle Relationships

*   **Opposite Angles:** When two lines intersect, the angles opposite each other are called opposite angles, and they are equal.
*   **Complementary Angles:** Two angles are complementary if their sum is 90 degrees.
*   **Adjacent Angles:** Adjacent angles share a common vertex and a common side but do not overlap.
*   **Supplementary Angles (or Linear Pair):** Two angles are supplementary if their sum is 180 degrees. If these two angles also form a straight line, they are called a linear pair.

This video explains the rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing positive and negative numbers.

### Addition and Subtraction

When adding or subtracting numbers with different signs (one positive and one negative), subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and use the sign of the number with the larger absolute value.

**Examples:**

*   **-7 + 4 = -3** (Subtract 4 from 7, then use the sign of 7, which is negative).
*   **-3 + 6 = +3** (Subtract 3 from 6, then use the sign of 6, which is positive).
*   **7 - 4 = 3** (Subtract 4 from 7, then use the sign of 7, which is positive).

When adding numbers with the same sign:
*   If both numbers are positive, add them and the result is positive.
    *   **5 + 3 = 8**
    *   **6 + 2 = 8**
*   If both numbers are negative, add their absolute values and the result is negative.
    *   **-7 + (-5) = -12** (Add 7 and 5, then use the negative sign).
    *   **-4 + (-3) = -7**
    *   **-6 + (-4) = -10**
    *   **-8 + (-5) = -13**

When dealing with subtraction involving negative numbers in parentheses:
*   A minus sign outside the bracket changes the sign of the number inside the bracket.
    *   **-10 - (-10) = -10 + 10 = 0**
    *   **7 - (-8) = 7 + 8 = 15**
    *   **-7 - (-12) = -7 + 12 = 5**
    *   **-3 - (-12) = -3 + 12 = 9** (Subtract 3 from 12, then use the sign of 12, which is positive).
    *   **11 - (-5) = 11 + 5 = 16**

### Multiplication

When multiplying numbers with different signs (one positive and one negative), the product is negative.
When multiplying numbers with the same sign (both positive or both negative), the product is positive.

**Examples:**

*   **+ × + = +**
*   **- × - = +**
*   **+ × - = -**
*   **- × + = -**

**Practice Questions (with solutions from the video):**

*   **7 × (-6) = -42**
*   **8 × (-9) = -72**
*   **8 × (-7) = -56**
*   **9 × (-9) = -81**
*   **5 × (-9) = -45**
*   **9 × (-8) = -72**
*   **9 × (-6) = -54**
*   **6 × (-1) = -6**

### Division

The rules for division with positive and negative numbers are the same as for multiplication.
When dividing numbers with different signs, the quotient is negative.
When dividing numbers with the same sign, the quotient is positive.

**Examples (with solutions from the video):**

*   **81 ÷ (-9) = -9**
*   **49 ÷ (-7) = -7**
*   **48 ÷ (-6) = -8**
*   **63 ÷ (-9) = -7**
*   **56 ÷ (-8) = -7**
*   **36 ÷ (-6) = -6**
*   **63 ÷ (-7) = -9**
*   **2 ÷ (-2) = -1**
*   **2 ÷ (-1) = -2**
*   **56 ÷ (-7) = -8**
*   **8 ÷ (-8) = -1**
*   **28 ÷ (-4) = -7**
*

# 41.Reading a number 

The video explains a trick for reading large numbers in the Indian numbering system. It starts by counting the total number of digits in the given number. Then, it subtracts 7 from the total number of digits. The result indicates how many digits from the left should be grouped together to represent the "Crores" place value. After this initial grouping, the remaining digits are grouped into pairs (two digits each) from left to right, representing "Lakhs", "Thousands", and finally the hundreds, tens, and ones place.

Here's a breakdown of the method from the video:

1.  **Count total digits:** Count the total number of digits in the given number.
2.  **Subtract 7:** Subtract 7 from the total count. This result determines the number of initial digits that form the "Crores" place.
3.  **First grouping (Crores):** Group the number of digits obtained from step 2, starting from the leftmost digit. This group represents the "Crores" value.
4.  **Subsequent groupings (Lakhs, Thousands, Hundreds):** After the initial "Crores" grouping, continue to group the remaining digits in pairs (two digits each) from left to right.
    *   The first pair after "Crores" represents "Lakhs".
    *   The next pair represents "Thousands".
    *   The final three digits represent "Hundreds" (and tens/ones).

**Example 1 from the video:**

*   **Number:** 25796565676
*   **Total Digits:** 11
*   **Subtract 7:** $11 - 7 = 4$
*   **Reading:**
    *   First 4 digits: 2579 (Crores)
    *   Next 2 digits: 65 (Lakhs)
    *   Next 2 digits: 65 (Thousands)
    *   Remaining 3 digits: 676 (Hundreds)
*   **Result:** Two thousand five hundred seventy-nine Crores, sixty-five Lakhs, sixty-five Thousand, six hundred seventy-six.

**Example 2 from the video:**

*   **Number:** 325431589
*   **Total Digits:** 9
*   **Subtract 7:** $9 - 7 = 2$
*   **Reading:**
    *   First 2 digits: 32 (Crores)
    *   Next 2 digits: 54 (Lakhs)
    *   Next 2 digits: 31 (Thousands)
    *   Remaining 3 digits: 589 (Hundreds)
*   **Result:** Thirty-two Crores, fifty-four Lakhs, thirty-one Thousand, five hundred eighty-nine.

**Example 3 from the video:**

*   **Number:** 5271437658
*   **Total Digits:** 10
*   **Subtract 7:** $10 - 7 = 3$
*   **Reading:**
    *   First 3 digits: 527 (Crores)
    *   Next 2 digits: 14 (Lakhs)
    *   Next 2 digits: 37 (Thousands)
    *   Remaining 3 digits: 658 (Hundreds)
*   **Result:** Five hundred twenty-seven Crores, fourteen Lakhs, thirty-seven Thousand, six hundred fifty-eight.## Reading Large Numbers: The Indian Numbering System Trick

The video demonstrates a trick for easily reading large numbers according to the Indian numbering system. This method simplifies the process by consistently applying a rule based on the total number of digits to identify the "Crores" place, followed by grouping remaining digits into pairs for "Lakhs" and "Thousands."

Here's a breakdown of the trick:

1.  **Count the Total Digits:** Begin by counting all the digits in the number.
2.  **Determine the "Crores" Group:** Subtract 7 from the total number of digits. The result indicates how many digits, starting from the leftmost side of the number, form the "Crores" place value.
3.  **Group Subsequent Place Values:** After the initial "Crores" grouping, continue to group the remaining digits in pairs of two from left to right.
    *   The first pair after the "Crores" represents the "Lakhs".
    *   The next pair represents the "Thousands".
    *   The final three digits (or remaining digits if fewer than three) represent the "Hundreds" (and tens/ones).

**Examples from the video:**

*   **Number:** 25796565676
    *   **Total Digits:** 11
    *   **Subtract 7:** $11 - 7 = 4$. This means the first 4 digits represent Crores.
    *   **Reading:** 2579 Crores, 65 Lakhs, 65 Thousand, 676.

*   **Number:** 325431589
    *   **Total Digits:** 9
    *   **Subtract 7:** $9 - 7 = 2$. This means the first 2 digits represent Crores.
    *   **Reading:** 32 Crores, 54 Lakhs, 31 Thousand, 589.

*   **Number:** 5271437658
    *   **Total Digits:** 10
    *   **Subtract 7:** $10 - 7 = 3$. This means the first 3 digits represent Crores.
    *   **Reading:** 527 Crores, 14 Lakhs, 37 Thousand, 658.
    * ## 42.Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dasatah

The Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dasatah method, often referred to as the Nikhilam method, is a Vedic mathematics trick primarily used for the multiplication of numbers that are near to bases like 10, 100, 1000, and so on (powers of 10). The formula simply means: "All from 9 and the last from 10".

**How it works (for numbers near a base of 10):**

1.  **Choose a base:** Select a power of 10 (e.g., 10, 100, 1000) that is closest to the numbers you want to multiply.
2.  **Find the differences:** Determine the difference between each number and the chosen base. These are called "deviations."
3.  **Multiply the differences:** Multiply the two deviations. This will form the right-hand side of your answer.
4.  **Cross-add/subtract:** Add or subtract one number with the deviation of the other number. This forms the left-hand side of your answer.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: Multiplying 9 x 9 (Base 10)**
    *   Numbers: 9, 9
    *   Base: 10
    *   Deviations:
        *   $9 - 10 = -1$
        *   $9 - 10 = -1$
    *   Multiply deviations: $(-1) \times (-1) = 1$
    *   Cross-subtract: $9 - 1 = 8$ (or $9 - 1 = 8$)
    *   **Result:** 81

*   **Example 2: Multiplying 11 x 11 (Base 10)**
    *   Numbers: 11, 11
    *   Base: 10
    *   Deviations:
        *   $11 - 10 = +1$
        *   $11 - 10 = +1$
    *   Multiply deviations: $(+1) \times (+1) = 1$
    *   Cross-add: $11 + 1 = 12$ (or $11 + 1 = 12$)
    *   **Result:** 121

*   **Example 3: Multiplying 19 x 19 (Base 10, but the video uses a different approach from the text description)**
    *   Numbers: 19, 19
    *   Base: 10
    *   Deviations:
        *   $19 - 10 = +9$
        *   $19 - 10 = +9$
    *   Multiply deviations: $9 \times 9 = 81$. (Carry over 8)
    *   Cross-add and add carry: $19 + 9 = 28$. $28 + 8 = 36$.
    *   **Result:** 361
    *   *Note: The video also shows an alternative approach using a base of 20, where the deviations would be -1 and -1. The calculation would be $(-1) \times (-1) = 1$ and $19 - 1 = 18$. Since the base is 20 (which is $2 \times 10$), we multiply 18 by 2 to get 36. So, 361.*

*   **Example 4: Multiplying 17 x 17 (Base 10)**
    *   Numbers: 17, 17
    *   Base: 10
    *   Deviations:
        *   $17 - 10 = +7$
        *   $17 - 10 = +7$
    *   Multiply deviations: $7 \times 7 = 49$. (Carry over 4)
    *   Cross-add and add carry: $17 + 7 = 24$. $24 + 4 = 28$.
    *   **Result:** 289

*   **Example 5: Multiplying 13 x 12 (Base 10)**
    *   Numbers: 13, 12
    *   Base: 10
    *   Deviations:
        *   $13 - 10 = +3$
        *   $12 - 10 = +2$
    *   Multiply deviations: $3 \times 2 = 6$
    *   Cross-add: $13 + 2 = 15$ (or $12 + 3 = 15$)
    *   **Result:** 156

*   **Example 6: Multiplying 49 x 49 (Working Base 50, which is 100/2)**
    *   Numbers: 49, 49
    *   Base: 50 (Working Base is $100/2$)
    *   Deviations:
        *   $49 - 50 = -1$
        *   $49 - 50 = -1$
    *   Multiply deviations: $(-1) \times (-1) = 01$ (ensure two digits as base is 100/2, implying two-digit right-hand side).
    *   Cross-subtract: $49 - 1 = 48$.
    *   Divide left-hand side by 2 (because 50 is $100/2$): $48 / 2 = 24$.
    *   **Result:** 2401

*   **Example 7: Multiplying 46 x 46 (Working Base 50, which is 100/2)**
    *   Numbers: 46, 46
    *   Base: 50 (Working Base is $100/2$)
    *   Deviations:
        *   $46 - 50 = -4$
        *   $46 - 50 = -4$
    *   Multiply deviations: $(-4) \times (-4) = 16$
    *   Cross-subtract: $46 - 4 = 42$.
    *   Divide left-hand side by 2: $42 / 2 = 21$.
    *   **Result:** 2116

*   **Example 8: Multiplying 43 x 48 (Working Base 50, which is 100/2)**
    *   Numbers: 43, 48
    *   Base: 50 (Working Base is $100/2$)
    *   Deviations:
        *   $43 - 50 = -7$
        *   $48 - 50 = -2$
    *   Multiply deviations: $(-7) \times (-2) = 14$
    *   Cross-subtract: $43 - 2 = 41$ (or $48 - 7 = 41$).
    *   Divide left-hand side by 2: $41 / 2 = 20.5$.
    *   Combine: $20.514$. *Note: The video shows an alternative method here, where the decimal is handled differently. For competitive exams, it's often preferred to keep integers. Let's follow the video's logic for combining, which seems to imply carrying over the decimal part to the next step, which is unusual for this method but leads to the correct answer shown.*
    *   *Video's interpretation for 43 x 48:* Deviations are +3 and +8 from base 40 (or -7 and -2 from base 50). The video explicitly uses base 50.
        *   $43 - 50 = -7$
        *   $48 - 50 = -2$
        *   $(-7) \times (-2) = 14$
        *   $43 - 2 = 41$.
        *   $41 / 2 = 20.5$.
        *   The video then combines $20$ and $14$ as $2014$.
        *   Then takes $25.5$ (from some other calculation not directly related to this example but from a similar context earlier in the video) and combines it as $2574$. It appears the presenter is trying to illustrate how the decimal part is carried. The direct application of the method would yield 20.514, or by carrying 0.5 * 100 to the next digit as 50. Then 2050 + 14 = 2064. The final result for 43 * 48 is actually 2064.

*   **Example 9: Multiplying 59 x 59 (Working Base 60, which is 10 x 6)**
    *   Numbers: 59, 59
    *   Base: 60 (Working Base is $10 \times 6$)
    *   Deviations:
        *   $59 - 60 = -1$
        *   $59 - 60 = -1$
    *   Multiply deviations: $(-1) \times (-1) = 1$
    *   Cross-subtract: $59 - 1 = 58$.
    *   Multiply left-hand side by 6 (because 60 is $10 \times 6$): $58 \times 6 = 348$.
    *   **Result:** 3481
    *   *Note: The video also shows an alternative approach using a base of 50 (100/2), which would yield: deviations +9, +9; $9 \times 9 = 81$; $59 + 9 = 68$; $68 / 2 = 34$. So, 3481.*

*   **Example 10: Multiplying 73 x 72 (Working Base 70, which is 10 x 7)**
    *   Numbers: 73, 72
    *   Base: 70 (Working Base is $10 \times 7$)
    *   Deviations:
        *   $73 - 70 = +3$
        *   $72 - 70 = +2$
    *   Multiply deviations: $3 \times 2 = 6$
    *   Cross-add: $73 + 2 = 75$ (or $72 + 3 = 75$).
    *   Multiply left-hand side by 7: $75 \times 7 = 525$.
    *   **Result:** 5256

*   **Example 11: Multiplying 19 x 19 (Working Base 20, which is 10 x 2)**
    *   Numbers: 19, 19
    *   Base: 20 (Working Base is $10 \times 2$)
    *   Deviations:
        *   $19 - 20 = -1$
        *   $19 - 20 = -1$
    *   Multiply deviations: $(-1) \times (-1) = 1$
    *   Cross-subtract: $19 - 1 = 18$.
    *   Multiply left-hand side by 2: $18 \times 2 = 36$.
    *   **Result:** 361

*   **Example 12: Multiplying 62 x 48 (Working Base 50, which is 100/2)**
    *   Numbers: 62, 48
    *   Base: 50 (Working Base is $100/2$)
    *   Deviations:
        *   $62 - 50 = +12$
        *   $48 - 50 = -2$
    *   Multiply deviations: $12 \times (-2) = -24$.
    *   Cross-add/subtract: $62 - 2 = 60$ (or $48 + 12 = 60$).
    *   Divide left-hand side by 2: $60 / 2 = 30$.
    *   Since the right-hand side is negative, we need to borrow from the left. $30 - 1 = 29$. The borrowed 1 (representing 100 in the context of the working base 100/2) is used to make the right-hand side positive: $100 - 24 = 76$.
    *   **Result:** 2976
    *   *Note: The video also shows an attempt with base 40, which leads to a more complex calculation and is explicitly stated as not working well with the "plus and minus" scenario.*

*   **Example 13: Multiplying 23 x 21 (Working Base 30, which is 10 x 3)**
    *   Numbers: 23, 21

    *   Multiply left-hand side by 3: $14 \times 3 = 42$.
    *   **Result:** 4263

*   **Example 14: Multiplying 687 x 699 (Working Base 700, which is 100 x 7)**

        *   $699 - 700 = -1$
    *   Multiply deviations: $(-13) \times (-1) = 13$.
    *   Cross-subtract: $687 - 1 = 686$ (or $699 - 13 = 686$).
    *   Multiply left-hand side by 7: $686 \times 7 = 4802$.
    *   **Result:** 480213

    *   Cross-add: $635 + 2 = 637$ (or $502 + 135 = 637$).
    *   Divide left-hand side by 2: $637 / 2 = 318.5$.
    *   Combine: $318.5270$. The .5 is added to the leftmost digit of the right hand side. So, $318,5270$. The video adds 5 to 270 as 770.
    *   **Result (as shown in video):** 318770
    *   *Note: This specific example demonstrates a unique handling of the decimal, where the .5 from 318.5 is somehow integrated into the right side digits (270 becoming 770 in the video). This is not standard Nikhilam, which would typically involve carrying over or rounding. The direct result of the arithmetic would be 318,5270. If you interpret ".5" as "500", then 318,500 + 270 = 318,770, which matches the video's answer.*

*   **Example 18: Multiplying 9997 x 8993 (Working Base 10000)**
    *   Numbers: 9997, 8993
    *   Base: 10000
    *   Deviations:
        *   $9997 - 10000 = -3$
        *   $8993 - 10000 = -1007$
    *   Multiply deviations: $(-3) \times (-1007) = 3021$ (ensure four digits as base is 10000, implying four-digit right-hand side).
    *   Cross-subtract: $9997 - 1007 = 8990$ (or $8993 - 3 = 8990$).
    *   **Result:** 89903021

*   **Example 19: Multiplying 87965 x 99998 (Working Base 100000)**
    *   Numbers: 87965, 99998
    *   Base: 100000
    *   Deviations:
        *   $87965 - 100000 = -12035$
        *   $99998 - 100000 = -2$
    *   Multiply deviations: $(-12035) \times (-2) = 24070$ (ensure five digits as base is 100000, implying five-digit right-hand side).
    *   Cross-subtract: $87965 - 2 = 87963$ (or $99998 - 12035 = 87963$).
    *   **Result:** 8796324070

**Key Points:**

*   The Nikhilam method is most effective when numbers are close to powers of 10.
*   The number of digits in the right-hand side of the answer should match the number of zeros in the chosen base.
*   If the product of deviations is negative, you "borrow" from the left-hand side.
*   If a "working base" (e.g., 50, 200, 500) is used, remember to divide or multiply the left-hand side of the answer by the same factor used to derive the working base from a power of 10.
* ## 43.Factors

A factor of a number in mathematics is a divisor of the given number that divides it completely, without leaving any remainder.

**How it works:**

To find the factors of a number, you need to identify all the numbers that can divide it evenly, leaving no remainder. Here's a systematic way to find factors, along with divisibility rules for common numbers:

1.  **Start with 1 and the number itself:** Every number has 1 and itself as factors.
2.  **Check for divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
3.  **Check for divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
4.  **Check for divisibility by 4:** A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits are divisible by 4.
5.  **Check for divisibility by 5:** A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.
6.  **Check for divisibility by 6:** A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.
7.  **Check for divisibility by 8:** A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits are divisible by 8.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: Factors of 8**
    *   1 (since 1 x 8 = 8)
    *   2 (since 2 x 4 = 8)
    *   4 (since 4 x 2 = 8)
    *   8 (since 8 x 1 = 8)
    *   **Factors:** 1, 2, 4, 8

*   **Example 2: Factors of 24**
    *   1 (since 1 x 24 = 24)
    *   2 (since 24 is an even number, 2 x 12 = 24)
    *   3 (since 2 + 4 = 6, and 6 is divisible by 3, 3 x 8 = 24)
    *   4 (since 24 is divisible by 4, 4 x 6 = 24)
    *   6 (since 24 is divisible by both 2 and 3, 6 x 4 = 24)
    *   8 (since 24 is divisible by 8, 8 x 3 = 24)
    *   12 (since 12 x 2 = 24)
    *   24 (since 24 x 1 = 24)
    *   **Factors:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24

*   **Example 3: Factors of 108**
    *   1 (since 1 x 108 = 108)
    *   2 (since 108 is an even number, 2 x 54 = 108)
    *   3 (since 1 + 0 + 8 = 9, and 9 is divisible by 3, 3 x 36 = 108)
    *   4 (since 08 is divisible by 4, 4 x 27 = 108)
    *   6 (since 108 is divisible by both 2 and 3, 6 x 18 = 108)
    *   8 (since 108 is not divisible by 8, (108/8 = 13 with remainder 4))
    *   9 (since 1 + 0 + 8 = 9, and 9 is divisible by 9, 9 x 12 = 108)
    *   12 (since 12 x 9 = 108)
    *   18 (since 18 x 6 = 108)
    *   27 (since 27 x 4 = 108)
    *   36 (since 36 x 3 = 108)
    *   54 (since 54 x 2 = 108)
    *   108 (since 108 x 1 = 108)
    *   **Factors:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, 108

*   **Example 4: Factors of 312324**
    *   To check if 312324 is divisible by 4, look at the last two digits: 24. Since 24 is divisible by 4, 312324 is divisible by 4.
    *   To check if 312324 is divisible by 8, look at the last three digits: 324. Since 324 is not divisible by 8 (324/8 = 40 with remainder 4), 312324 is not divisible by 8.
    *   To check if 312324 is divisible by 9, sum the digits: 3+1+2+3+2+4 = 15. Since 15 is not divisible by 9, 312324 is not divisible by 9.
    *   To check if 71350 is divisible by 5, look at the last digit: 0. Since the last digit is 0, 71350 is divisible by 5.

**Important Divisibility Rules mentioned in the video:**

*   **For 2:** All even numbers are divisible by 2.
*   **For 3:** If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, the number itself is divisible by 3.

*   **For 10:** If the last digit of a number is 0, the number itself is divisible by 10.
*   **For 11:** If a two-digit number has both digits identical (e.g., 22, 33, 44), it is divisible by 11.
* ## 44.Counting Squares and Rectangles

This method provides a systematic approach to counting the number of squares and rectangles within a given grid. This is a common type of problem in competitive exams, scholarship exams, and Olympiads.

**How it works (for squares):**

1.  **Identify rows and columns:** Label the rows and columns of the grid with consecutive numbers, starting from 1.
2.  **Check for equal rows and columns (for squares):** If the number of rows (R) is equal to the number of columns (C), then the figure is a square grid.
3.  **Apply the formula for squares:** Sum the squares of the numbers from 1 up to the maximum number of rows (or columns).
    *   Formula: $R^2 + (R-1)^2 + (R-2)^2 + ... + 1^2$ (where R is the maximum number of rows/columns).

**How it works (for rectangles):**

1.  **Identify rows and columns:** Label the rows and columns of the grid with consecutive numbers, starting from 1.
2.  **Apply the formula for rectangles:**
    *   Calculate the sum of numbers in the rows: $S_R = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + R = \frac{R(R+1)}{2}$
    *   Calculate the sum of numbers in the columns: $S_C = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + C = \frac{C(C+1)}{2}$
    *   The total number of rectangles is the product of these two sums: $N_{Rectangles} = S_R \times S_C = \frac{R(R+1)}{2} \times \frac{C(C+1)}{2}$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: Counting squares in a 5x5 grid**
    *   Rows (R) = 5, Columns (C) = 5 (It's a square grid)
    *   Formula: $5^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2$
    *   Calculation: $25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 55$
    *   **Result:** 55 squares

*   **Example 2: Counting squares in a 4x4 grid**
    *   Rows (R) = 4, Columns (C) = 4 (It's a square grid)
    *   Formula: $4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2$
    *   Calculation: $16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 30$
    *   **Result:** 30 squares

*   **Example 3: Counting squares in a 3x3 grid**
    *   Rows (R) = 3, Columns (C) = 3 (It's a square grid)
    *   Formula: $3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2$
    *   Calculation: $9 + 4 + 1 = 14$
    *   **Result:** 14 squares

*   **Example 4: Counting rectangles in a 7x4 grid**
    *   Rows (R) = 7, Columns (C) = 4
    *   Sum of rows: $S_R = \frac{7(7+1)}{2} = \frac{7 \times 8}{2} = 7 \times 4 = 28$
    *   Sum of columns: $S_C = \frac{4(4+1)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 5}{2} = 2 \times 5 = 10$
    *   Total rectangles: $N_{Rectangles} = S_R \times S_C = 28 \times 10 = 280$
    *   **Result:** 280 rectangles

*   **Example 5: Counting rectangles in a 4x3 grid**
    *   Rows (R) = 4, Columns (C) = 3
    *   Sum of rows: $S_R = \frac{4(4+1)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 5}{2} = 2 \times 5 = 10$
    *   Sum of columns: $S_C = \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = \frac{3 \times 4}{2} = 3 \times 2 = 6$
    *   Total rectangles: $N_{Rectangles} = S_R \times S_C = 10 \times 6 = 60$
    *   **Result:** 60 rectangles

**Key Points:**

*   For square grids (rows = columns), use the sum of squares formula.
*   For rectangular grids (rows ≠ columns), use the product of the sums of consecutive numbers for rows and columns.
*   These tricks allow for much faster calculation than manually counting individual shapes, especially in larger grids.
*   Practice is key to mastering these methods for competitive exams.
* The user is requesting an extraction of information from the video in the same format as the provided examples. However, the video is not about integration tricks but rather discusses the Indian numbering system and place values for large numbers. Therefore, the requested information cannot be extracted directly in the provided schema. I will instead summarize the key concepts explained in the video about the Indian numbering system.

## 45.Indian Numbering System: Place Values for Large Numbers

The video explains the Indian numbering system, focusing on place values beyond what is typically taught in elementary school. The presenter highlights that while most students are familiar with place values up to crores, the Indian system has designations for even larger numbers.

**Standard Place Values (up to 10 Crores):**

The presenter first reviews the common place values:
*   Ones
*   Tens
*   Hundreds
*   Thousands
*   Ten Thousands
*   Lakhs
*   Ten Lakhs
*   Crores
*   Ten Crores

**Extended Place Values in the Indian System:**

Beyond "Ten Crores," the Indian system includes the following place values:
*   **One Arab** (equal to 100 Crores)
*   **Ten Arab**
*   **One Kharab**
*   **Ten Kharab**
*   **One Nil**
*   **Ten Nil**
*   **One Padma**
*   **Ten Padma**
*   **One Shankh**
*   **Ten Shankh**

The presenter emphasizes that knowing these 19 place values allows one to read and comprehend very large numbers in the Indian system.

**Examples of Reading Large Numbers (as demonstrated in the video):**

The video provides two large numbers and demonstrates how to read them using the Indian numbering system. The numbers are:

1.  **2458536473465432187**
2.  **3563278954326789643**

The presenter walks through the place values from right to left for each digit, indicating where each new denomination (like Thousands, Lakhs, Crores, Arab, Kharab, Nil, Padma, Shankh) applies.

**Reading Example 1: 2458536473465432187**
*   The number is read as:
    *   24 Shankh 
    *   58 Padma
    *   53 Nil 
    *   64 Kharab 
    *   73 Arab 
    *   46 Crore 
    *   54 Lakhs
    *   32 Thousand 
    *   187 (One Hundred Eighty-Seven) 

**Reading Example 2: 3563278954326789643**
*   The number is read as:
    *   35 Shankh 
    *   63 Padma 
    *   27 Nil 
    *   89 Kharab 
    *   54 Arab 
    *   32 Crore 
    *   67 Lakhs
    *   89 Thousand 
    *   643 (Six Hundred Forty-Three) 

**Key Takeaway:**

The video emphasizes that while school textbooks might only cover up to 10 or 11 digits (up to Crores), understanding the full 19-place Indian numbering system allows for reading and comprehending even extremely large numbers. The presenter encourages learners to practice writing out these numbers and their corresponding place values.
The user is requesting an extraction of information from the video in the same format as the provided examples. However, the video is not about integration tricks but rather discusses the International numbering system and place values for large numbers. Therefore, the requested information cannot be extracted directly in the provided schema. I will instead summarize the key concepts explained in the video about the International numbering system.

## 46.International Numbering System: Place Values for Large Numbers

The video explains the International numbering system, contrasting it with the Indian system and detailing its place values for large numbers. The presenter categorizes these place values into groups of three digits, making it easier to read and understand large numbers.

**Key Concepts of the International System:**

The International system groups numbers into sets of three digits. The presenter outlines the hierarchical structure of these groups:

*   **First Group (Units):**
    *   One
    *   Tens
    *   Hundreds

*   **Second Group (Thousands):**
    *   Thousands 
    *   Ten Thousands 
    *   Hundred Thousands 

*   **Third Group (Millions):**
    *   Million 
    *   Ten Million 
    *   Hundred Million 

*   **Fourth Group (Billions):**
    *   Billion 
    *   Ten Billion 
    *   Hundred Billion 

*   **Fifth Group (Trillions):**
    *   Trillion
    *   Ten Trillion 
    *   Hundred Trillion 

*   **Sixth Group (Quadrillions):**
    *   Quadrillion
    *   Ten Quadrillion 
    *   Hundred Quadrillion 

The presenter explains that currently, the International System commonly extends up to Quadrillions. Each of these groups consists of a "one," "ten," and "hundred" equivalent for that particular magnitude (e.g., One Thousand, Ten Thousand, Hundred Thousand).

**Examples of Reading Large Numbers:**

The video provides several examples of numbers and demonstrates how to read them using the International numbering system by grouping digits in threes from right to left.

1.  **245853647346543218**
    *   The presenter breaks this down by marking every three digits from the right.
    *   **245** (first three digits from left)
    *   **853**
    *   **647**
    *   **346**
    *   **543**
    *   **218** (last three digits)
    *   Reading it aloud, the presenter says: "Eight hundred fifty-three Trillion, six hundred forty-seven Billion, three hundred forty-six Million, five hundred forty-three Thousand, two hundred eighteen." 

2.  **32713782**
    *   Grouping: **32**, **713**, **782**
    *   Reading: "Thirty-two Million, seven hundred thirteen Thousand, seven hundred eighty-two."

3.  **6712364381**
    *   Grouping: **6**, **712**, **364**, **381**
    *   Reading: "Six Billion, seven hundred twelve Million, three hundred sixty-four Thousand, three hundred eighty-one." 

4.  **245789**
    *   This is a shorter example, already presented in groups of three.
    *   Reading: "Two hundred forty-five Thousand, seven hundred eighty-nine."

5.  **1452582537**
    *   Grouping: **1**, **452**, **582**, **537**
    *   Reading: "One Billion, four hundred fifty-two Million, five hundred eighty-two Thousand, five hundred thirty-seven."

6.  **326812543**
    *   Grouping: **326**, **812**, **543**
    *   Reading: "Three hundred twenty-six Million, eight hundred twelve Thousand, five hundred forty-three." 

The video also includes exercises where a number is given in words and the user is asked to write it in numerals (standard form), emphasizing the importance of correctly placing zeros to fill the three-digit groups. 
The user is requesting an extraction of information from the video in the same format as the provided examples. However, the video is not about integration tricks but rather discusses various units of length and their conversions. Therefore, the requested information cannot be extracted directly in the provided schema. I will instead summarize the key concepts explained in the video about length conversions.

## 47.Length Conversion: Units and Conversion Factors

The video discusses various units of length and their conversions, emphasizing their importance in daily life and in specific fields like physics and competitive exams. The presenter covers both metric and imperial units, along with some specialized units.

**Introduction to Length and Measurement:**

The video begins by stating that all things have measurements, including length, weight, and value. Length is the focus of this discussion. The presenter introduces common units for length such as centimeters, meters, and kilometers. Other units mentioned include millimeters, nautical miles, inches, and feet.

**Key Length Conversion Factors (Metric to Metric):**

The presenter highlights the following essential metric conversions:

*   **1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters (m)** 
    *   To convert kilometers to meters, multiply by 1000. 
    *   Example: 2 km = 2000 m, 3 km = 3000 m 
*   **1 meter (m) = 100 centimeters (cm)** 
    *   To convert meters to centimeters, multiply by 100. 
    *   Example: 5 m = 500 cm 
*   **1 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 meters (m)** or **10^-2 meters (m)** 
    *   To convert centimeters to meters, divide by 100.
*   **1 millimeter (mm) = 10^-3 meters (m)** 
*   **1 centimeter (cm) = 10 millimeters (mm)** 

**Specialized and Imperial Length Units:**

The video also covers specialized and imperial units, often encountered in specific contexts:

*   **1 Angstrom (Å) = 10^-10 meters (m)**  (Also mentioned as 1/10^10 meters) This unit is particularly relevant in physics. 
*   **1 foot (ft) = 30.48 centimeters (cm)** 
    *   This is often used for measuring height.
*   **1 inch (in) = 2.54 centimeters (cm)** 
*   **1 yard (yd) = 0.9144 meters (m)** (Also mentioned in terms of feet, where 1 yard = 3 feet) 
*   **1 mile (mi) = 0.6214 kilometers (km)** (To convert kilometers to miles, multiply by 0.6214). This is commonly used in marathon races. 
*   **1 nautical mile = 6080 feet (ft)** This is used for measuring distances at sea. 
*   **1 light year = 9.461 × 10^15 meters (m)**  This unit measures astronomical distances. 

**Practical Conversions and Examples from the video:**

The video provides a table with numerous conversion examples and encourages learners to practice them. Some of these include:

*   **1 m = 1000 mm = 10^6 µm = 10^9 nm** 
*   **5000 m = 5 km** 
*   **400 cm = 4 m** 
*   **80 mm = 8 cm** 
*   **2.5 km = 2500 m** 
*   **2 m = 200 cm** 
*   **1 m = 1000 mm** 
*   **9 m = 9000 mm** 
*   **0.8 m = 80 cm** 
*   **1.5 cm = 15 mm** 

**Importance of Practice:**

The presenter reiterates that understanding these conversions is crucial for solving problems in various contexts. He encourages viewers to watch the class multiple times, memorize the conversion factors, and actively practice solving related problems to master the concepts.

TOPIC 1
## Multiplication Trick for 259 x 39 x A NUMBER

This trick provides a shortcut for multiplying numbers in the format of "259 x 39 x a NUMBER."

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the numbers:** The trick applies when you have 259 and 39 as two of the multiplicands. The third multiplicand can be any number.

2.  **The "trick"**: If the number being multiplied with 259 and 39 is a two-digit number, simply write that two-digit number three times to get the answer. If it's a single-digit number, write '0' before the digit to make it a two-digit number, and then repeat it three times.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: 259 x 39 x 67
    *   The "NUMBER" is 67 (a two-digit number).
    *   Result: 676767

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: 259 x 39 x 53
    *   The "NUMBER" is 53 (a two-digit number).
    *   Result: 535353

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: 259 x 39 x 17
    *   The "NUMBER" is 17 (a two-digit number).
    *   Result: 171717

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: 259 x 3 x 13 x 7
    *   First, recognize that 3 x 13 = 39. So the problem is effectively 259 x 39 x 7.
    *   The "NUMBER" is 7 (a single-digit number).
    *   Convert to two digits: 07
    *   Result: 070707

*   **Example 5:**
    *   Problem: 259 x 3 x 5 x 13 x 2 x 3
    *   First, identify the 259.
    *   Next, look for factors that multiply to 39: 3 x 13 = 39.
    *   Now, multiply the remaining numbers: 5 x 2 x 3 = 30.
    *   The problem is effectively 259 x 39 x 30.
    *   The "NUMBER" is 30 (a two-digit number).
    *   Result: 303030

**Key Points:**

*   This trick relies on the specific properties of the numbers 259 and 39.
*   The number "39" can be presented as factors, like "3 x 13".
*   If the third multiplicand is a single-digit number, prepend a '0' to it before applying the repetition.

TOPIC 2
## Single Digit Multiplication Trick

This trick offers a faster way to perform multiplication of a multi-digit number by a single-digit number by working from left to right, which can help in reducing errors compared to the traditional right-to-left method.

*How it works:*

1.  **Start from the leftmost digit:** Multiply the leftmost digit of the multi-digit number by the single-digit multiplier.
2.  **Record the partial product:**
    *   If the product is a single digit, write it down.
    *   If the product is a two-digit number, write the tens digit as a small carry-over directly above the *next* digit of the multi-digit number (to the right), and write the units digit directly below the current digit as part of your running total.
3.  **Continue to the right:** Repeat the multiplication for each subsequent digit of the multi-digit number, applying the same carry-over rule.
4.  **Sum vertically:** Once all multiplications are done, sum the numbers vertically, including the small carry-over digits, to get the final result.

##   TOPIC 3:   Trick: Multiplying by 15

This trick provides a shortcut for quickly multiplying any number by 15 without the need for pen and paper for complex calculations.

*How it works:*

1.  **Add a zero:** Take the number you want to multiply by 15 and add a zero to its right, effectively multiplying it by 10.
    *   Example: For $45 \times 15$, start with $450$.
    *   Example: For $48 \times 15$, start with $480$.

2.  **Find half:** Calculate half of the new number obtained in Step 1.
    *   Example: Half of $450$ is $225$.
    *   Example: Half of $480$ is $240$.

3.  **Add the results:** Add the number from Step 1 (the original number with a zero added) and the number from Step 2 (its half). The sum is the final product.
    *   Example: $450 + 225 = 675$.
    *   Example: $480 + 240 = 720$.

*General Formula:*

To calculate $N \times 15$:
$$ N \times 15 = (N \times 10) + \frac{(N \times 10)}{2} $$
Or,
$$ N \times 15 = (N \text{ appended with 0}) + (\text{half of } N \text{ appended with 0}) $$

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $$ 45 \times 15 $$
    *   Step 1 (Add zero): $450$
    *   Step 2 (Find half): $225$
    *   Step 3 (Add): $450 + 225 = 675$
    *   *Result:* $$ 675 $$

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $$ 48 \times 15 $$
    *   Step 1 (Add zero): $480$
    *   Step 2 (Find half): $240$
    *   Step 3 (Add): $480 + 240 = 720$
    *   *Result:* $$ 720 $$

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $$ 32 \times 15 $$
    *   Step 1 (Add zero): $320$
    *   Step 2 (Find half): $160$
    *   Step 3 (Add): $320 + 160 = 480$
    *   *Result:* $$ 480 $$

*   *Example 4:*
    *   Problem: $$ 74 \times 15 $$
    *   Step 1 (Add zero): $740$
    *   Step 2 (Find half): $370$
    *   Step 3 (Add): $740 + 370 = 1110$
    *   *Result:* $$ 1110 $$

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is applicable for multiplying any integer by 15.

This video explains a Vedic math trick for multiplying two numbers between 40 and 50.

## TOPIC 7: Multiplication of Numbers Between 40 & 50

This trick provides a shortcut for multiplying two numbers between 40 and 50.

*How it works:*

1.  *Find the difference from 50:* For each number, calculate how much less it is than 50.
    *   Example 1: For $43 \times 46$
        *   $50 - 43 = 7$
        *   $50 - 46 = 4$
    *   Example 2: For $48 \times 48$
        *   $50 - 48 = 2$
        *   $50 - 48 = 2$
    *   Example 3: For $42 \times 46$
        *   $50 - 42 = 8$
        *   $50 - 46 = 4$
    *   Example 4: For $47 \times 49$
        *   $50 - 47 = 3$
        *   $50 - 49 = 1$

2.  *Multiply the differences:* Multiply the two differences obtained in the previous step. This product forms the last two digits of the answer. If the product is a single digit, add a leading zero.
    *   Example 1: $7 \times 4 = 28$
    *   Example 2: $2 \times 2 = 4 \rightarrow 04$
    *   Example 3: $8 \times 4 = 32$
    *   Example 4: $3 \times 1 = 3 \rightarrow 03$

3.  *Cross-subtract from 25:* Subtract the second difference from the first number (or the first difference from the second number), then divide by 2. This result forms the first part of the answer. Alternatively, subtract the first number from 25, then subtract the second difference.
    *   Example 1: ($43 - 4$) / 2 = $39 / 2 = 19.5$. The speaker makes a slight error here and says to add the .5 to the "2" of "28" but what he means is to add the 19 to the thousands and hundreds place and then carry over if needed. In this case, 19 + 2 = 21, and the .5 is handled by the 8. But the general trick for numbers in this range is usually to subtract from 25. So, for 43, $25 - (50-43) = 25 - 7 = 18$. For 46, $25 - (50-46) = 25 - 4 = 21$. This part of the trick seems to be slightly different from the standard Vedic math approach for numbers near 50, where you subtract the 'difference from 50' from 25. Let's follow the speaker's method to correctly represent the video. Speaker's approach: take 43-4 = 39, and divide by 2 to get 19.5. This .5 is carried over to the last two digits portion.
    *   Example 2: ($48 - 2$) / 2 = $46 / 2 = 23$. No point, so just 23.
    *   Example 3: ($42 - 4$) / 2 = $38 / 2 = 19$. No point, so just 19.
    *   Example 4: ($47 - 1$) / 2 = $46 / 2 = 23$. No point, so just 23.

4.  *Combine the results:* Combine the result from step 3 (first part) with the result from step 2 (last two digits) to get the final answer. If there was a .5 in step 3, the "point" is handled by adding 50 to the last two digits.
    *   Example 1: $19.5$ and $28$. Add the $0.5 \times 100 = 50$ to 28, so $28+50=78$. Then combine with 19. Result: $1978$.
    *   Example 2: $23$ and $04 \rightarrow 2304$
    *   Example 3: $19$ and $32 \rightarrow 1932$
    *   Example 4: $23$ and $03 \rightarrow 2303$

*Examples from the video (with solutions following the speaker's method):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $43 \times 46$
    *   Difference from 50: $50 - 43 = 7$, $50 - 46 = 4$
    *   Multiply differences: $7 \times 4 = 28$
    *   Cross-subtract and halve: $(43 - 4) / 2 = 39 / 2 = 19.5$. Add the .5 to the last two digits (i.e. add 50 to 28), making it 78.
    *   *Result:* $1978$

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $48 \times 48$
    *   Difference from 50: $50 - 48 = 2$, $50 - 48 = 2$
    *   Multiply differences: $2 \times 2 = 04$
    *   Cross-subtract and halve: $(48 - 2) / 2 = 46 / 2 = 23$
    *   *Result:* $2304$

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $42 \times 46$
    *   Difference from 50: $50 - 42 = 8$, $50 - 46 = 4$
    *   Multiply differences: $8 \times 4 = 32$
    *   Cross-subtract and halve: $(42 - 4) / 2 = 38 / 2 = 19$
    *   *Result:* $1932$

*   *Example 4:*
    *   Problem: $47 \times 49$
    *   Difference from 50: $50 - 47 = 3$, $50 - 49 = 1$
    *   Multiply differences: $3 \times 1 = 03$
    *   Cross-subtract and halve: $(47 - 1) / 2 = 46 / 2 = 23$
    *   *Result:* $2303$


## TOPIC 8  :Tricks of 25

This trick provides a shortcut for multiplying a number by 25.

*How it works:*

1.  *Add two zeros:* Take the number you want to multiply by 25 and append two zeros to its end.
    *   Example 1: For $25 \times 36$, 36 becomes 3600.
    *   Example 2: For $48 \times 25$, 48 becomes 4800.
    *   Example 3: For $53 \times 25$, 53 becomes 5300.
    *   Example 4: For $79 \times 25$, 79 becomes 7900.

2.  *Halve the number twice:* Divide the new number (with two zeros appended) by 2, and then divide the result by 2 again. This is equivalent to dividing by 4.
    *   Example 1: $3600 \div 2 = 1800$, then $1800 \div 2 = 900$.
    *   Example 2: $4800 \div 2 = 2400$, then $2400 \div 2 = 1200$.
    *   Example 3: $5300 \div 2 = 2650$, then $2650 \div 2 = 1325$.
    *   Example 4: $7900 \div 2 = 3950$, then $3950 \div 2 = 1975$.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $25 \times 36$
    *   Step 1: 3600
    *   Step 2: $3600 \div 2 = 1800$
    *   Step 3: $1800 \div 2 = 900$
    *   *Result:* 900

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $48 \times 25$
    *   Step 1: 4800
    *   Step 2: $4800 \div 2 = 2400$
    *   Step 3: $2400 \div 2 = 1200$
    *   *Result:* 1200

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $53 \times 25$
    *   Step 1: 5300
    *   Step 2: $5300 \div 2 = 2650$
    *   Step 3: $2650 \div 2 = 1325$
    *   *Result:* 1325

*   *Example 4:*
    *   Problem: $79 \times 25$
    *   Step 1: 7900
    *   Step 2: $7900 \div 2 = 3950$
    *   Step 3: $3950 \div 2 = 1975$
    *   *Result:* 1975

*Key Points:*
*   This trick is particularly useful for mental calculations, especially with even numbers.
*   Dividing by 25 is equivalent to multiplying by 4, so this trick essentially multiplies the number by 100 and then divides by 4.

## TOPIC 9: Two-Digit Random Multiplication

This video demonstrates a speed math technique for multiplying two-digit numbers. The method involves three main steps, which can be applied either by writing them down or by performing mental calculations.

### Method for Written Calculation:

1.  **Multiply the units digits:** Multiply the rightmost digits of both numbers. Write down the unit digit of this product and carry over the tens digit.
2.  **Cross-multiply and add:** Multiply the units digit of the first number by the tens digit of the second number, and the tens digit of the first number by the units digit of the second number. Add these two products together, and then add any carry-over from the previous step. Write down the unit digit of this sum and carry over the tens digit.
3.  **Multiply the tens digits:** Multiply the leftmost digits of both numbers. Add any remaining carry-over to this product. Write down the result.

**Example: 27 x 93**

1.  **Units digits:** $7 \times 3 = 21$. Write down '1', carry over '2'.
2.  **Cross-multiply and add:** $(2 \times 3) + (9 \times 7) = 6 + 63 = 69$. Add the carry-over: $69 + 2 = 71$. Write down '1', carry over '7'.
3.  **Tens digits:** $2 \times 9 = 18$. Add the carry-over: $18 + 7 = 25$. Write down '25'.
    *   Result: 2511

**Example: 84 x 55**

1.  **Units digits:** $4 \times 5 = 20$. Write down '0', carry over '2'.
2.  **Cross-multiply and add:** $(8 \times 5) + (5 \times 4) = 40 + 20 = 60$. Add the carry-over: $60 + 2 = 62$. Write down '2', carry over '6'.
3.  **Tens digits:** $8 \times 5 = 40$. Add the carry-over: $40 + 6 = 46$. Write down '46'.
    *   Result: 4620

### Method for Mental Calculation:

This method prioritizes the cross-multiplication step to build the number from left to right in your mind.

1.  **Cross-multiply and add (first part):** Multiply the tens digit of the first number by the units digit of the second number, and the units digit of the first number by the tens digit of the second number. Add these two products. Keep this sum in your mind (e.g., in your left hand, as demonstrated in the video).
2.  **Multiply the tens digits:** Multiply the leftmost digits of both numbers. This forms the first part of your final answer.
3.  **Combine and adjust:** Take the tens digit of the product from step 2 and add it to the sum you were holding (from step 1). The result of this addition forms the next part of your answer. Any tens digit from this new sum becomes a carry-over to the product of the tens digits (from step 2).
4.  **Multiply the units digits:** Multiply the rightmost digits of both numbers. The tens digit of this product becomes a carry-over to the current sum, and the unit digit is the final digit of your answer.

**Example: 58 x 47**

1.  **Cross-multiply (mental sum):** $(5 \times 7) + (4 \times 8) = 35 + 32 = 67$. (Keep '67' in mind).
2.  **Multiply tens digits:** $5 \times 4 = 20$. (This is the start of the answer, so far: 20...).
3.  **Combine and adjust:** Take the '6' (tens digit of 67) and add it to 20: $20 + 6 = 26$. Now, the number in your mind is '26' and you're left with '7' from the '67'. So the answer starts with 26.
4.  **Multiply units digits:** $8 \times 7 = 56$. Take the '5' (tens digit of 56) and add it to the '7' you had: $7 + 5 = 12$. Now, the number in your mind is '2' (unit digit of 12) and '1' is carried over. So, '26' becomes '27' (from adding the '1' carried over), and the current number is '2'. The remaining '6' from '56' is the last digit.
    *   Result: 2726

    *(Note: The video's explanation for this mental calculation is a bit fragmented, but this is the general idea of how to break down the calculation for mental processing.)*

**Example: 63 x 92**

1.  **Cross-multiply (mental sum):** $(6 \times 2) + (9 \times 3) = 12 + 27 = 39$. (Keep '39' in mind).
2.  **Multiply tens digits:** $6 \times 9 = 54$. (Start of answer: 54...).
3.  **Combine and adjust:** Take the '3' (tens digit of 39) and add it to 54: $54 + 3 = 57$. Now, the number in your mind is '57' and you're left with '9' from the '39'. So the answer starts with 57.
4.  **Multiply units digits:** $3 \times 2 = 6$. This is a single digit, so it's the last digit. You had '9' from the cross-multiplication, so the final part is '96'.
    *   Result: 5796

The video emphasizes that practice is key to mastering these techniques and increasing calculation speed.

##  TOPIC 11: Tricks of 55

This trick provides a shortcut for multiplying any number by 55.

*How it works:*

1.  *Append a zero and divide by 2:* Take the number you are multiplying by 55, append a zero to it, and then divide the new number by 2. This is equivalent to multiplying by 5.5, which is $\frac{110}{20} = \frac{11}{2}$.
    *   Example 1: $55 \times 78$
        *   $78 \rightarrow 780$
        *   $780 \div 2 = 390$
    *   Example 2: $55 \times 42$
        *   $42 \rightarrow 420$
        *   $420 \div 2 = 210$
    *   Example 3: $55 \times 32$
        *   $32 \rightarrow 320$
        *   $320 \div 2 = 160$
    *   Example 4: $55 \times 73$
        *   $73 \rightarrow 730$
        *   $730 \div 2 = 365$

2.  *Add the number to itself, shifted:* Take the result from step 1 and add it to itself, but shifted one decimal place to the left (or shifted by one place value). This effectively multiplies the result of step 1 by 11.
    *   Example 1:
        ```
          390
        + 390
        -----
          4290
        ```
    *   Example 2:
        ```
          210
        + 210
        -----
          2310
        ```
    *   Example 3:
        ```
          160
        + 160
        -----
          1760
        ```
    *   Example 4:
        ```
          365
        + 365
        -----
          4015
        ```

*General Formula:*

To multiply a number $N$ by 55:
$$ \left( \frac{N \times 10}{2} \right) \times 11 $$
or, more practically as shown in the video:
$$ (N \times 5) + (N \times 50) $$
which is simplified as:
1. Calculate $N \times 10 / 2$.
2. Add the result to itself, shifted by one decimal place to the left.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $55 \times 78$
    *   Step 1: $780 \div 2 = 390$
    *   Step 2:
        ```
          390
        + 390
        -----
          4290
        ```
    *   *Result:* $4290$

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $55 \times 42$
    *   Step 1: $420 \div 2 = 210$
    *   Step 2:
        ```
          210
        + 210
        -----
          2310
        ```
    *   *Result:* $2310$

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $55 \times 32$
    *   Step 1: $320 \div 2 = 160$
    *   Step 2:
        ```
          160
        + 160
        -----
          1760
        ```
    *   *Result:* $1760$

*   *Example 4:*
    *   Problem: $55 \times 73$
    *   Step 1: $730 \div 2 = 365$
    *   Step 2:
        ```
          365
        + 365
        -----
          4015
        ```
    *   *Result:* $4015$

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is a quick method for multiplying by 55.
*   It leverages the fact that $55 = 5.5 \times 10 = \frac{11}{2} \times 10$.
*   The "append zero and divide by 2" step calculates $N \times 5$.
*   The subsequent "add to itself, shifted" step calculates $(N \times 5) \times 11$.


##  Topic 12: Near 200 Multiplication

This method provides a shortcut for multiplying two numbers that are close to 200.

*How it works:*

1.  *Multiply the last two digits:* Multiply the last two digits of each number.
    *   Example 1: $204 \times 207$
        *   Last two digits are $04$ and $07$.
        *   $04 \times 07 = 28$.
    *   Example 2: $208 \times 218$
        *   Last two digits are $08$ and $18$.
        *   $08 \times 18 = 144$.
    *   Example 3: $216 \times 205$
        *   Last two digits are $16$ and $05$.
        *   $16 \times 05 = 80$.

2.  *Record the last two digits of the product and carry over if necessary:* Write down the last two digits of the product obtained in step 1. If the product is a three-digit number, carry over the hundreds digit.
    *   Example 1: $28$ (no carry-over).
    *   Example 2: $44$ (carry-over $1$).
    *   Example 3: $80$ (no carry-over).

3.  *Add the first number to the last two digits of the second number:* Take the entire first number and add it to the last two digits of the second number.
    *   Example 1: $204 + 07 = 211$.
    *   Example 2: $208 + 18 = 226$.
    *   Example 3: $216 + 05 = 221$.

4.  *Double the result from step 3 and add any carry-over:* Double the sum obtained in step 3. If there was a carry-over from step 2, add it to this doubled value.
    *   Example 1: $211 \times 2 = 422$.
    *   Example 2: $226 \times 2 = 452$. Add the carry-over of $1$: $452 + 1 = 453$.
    *   Example 3: $221 \times 2 = 442$.

5.  *Combine the results:* Place the result from step 4 in front of the two digits recorded in step 2.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $204 \times 207$
    *   Step 1: $04 \times 07 = 28$
    *   Step 2: Write down $28$.

    *   *Result:* $42228$

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $208 \times 218$
    *   Step 1: $08 \times 18 = 144$
    *   Step 2: Write down $44$, carry over $1$.
    *   Step 3: $208 + 18 = 226$
    *   Step 4: $226 \times 2 = 452$. Add carry-over $1$: $452 + 1 = 453$.
    *   *Result:* $45344$

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $216 \times 205$
    *   Step 1: $16 \times 05 = 80$
    *   Step 2: Write down $80$.
    *   Step 3: $216 + 05 = 221$
    *   Step 4: $221 \times 2 = 442$.
    *   *Result:* $44280$

## Near 100 Multiplication Trick (One Number Above 100, One Below)

This trick provides a shortcut for multiplying two numbers that are close to 100, specifically when one number is greater than 100 and the other is less than 100.

*How it works:*

1.  **Determine the difference from 100 for each number:**
    *   If a number is above 100, note the positive difference.
    *   If a number is below 100, note the negative difference.
    *   *Example:* For $104 \times 98$:
        *   $104$ is $4$ more than $100$ (so, $+4$).
        *   $98$ is $2$ less than $100$ (so, $-2$).

2.  **Multiply these differences:**
    *   *Example:* $(+4) \times (-2) = -8$.
    *   Since the signs are different, the product will be negative.

3.  **Calculate the last two digits of the answer:**
    *   Subtract the absolute value of the product from step 2 from 100.
    *   *Example:* $100 - 8 = 92$. These are the last two digits.

4.  **Calculate the first part of the answer:**
    *   Perform a "cross-operation":
        *   Subtract the negative difference from the larger number, OR
        *   Add the positive difference to the smaller number.
    *   *Example:* $104 - 2 = 102$ OR $98 + 4 = 102$.
    *   Then, subtract 1 from this result.
    *   *Example:* $102 - 1 = 101$.

5.  **Combine the results:**
    *   Place the result from step 4 (the first part) before the result from step 3 (the last two digits).

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $104 \times 98$
    *   Differences from 100: $+4$, $-2$. 
    *   Multiply differences: $4 \times (-2) = -8$. 
    *   Last two digits: $100 - 8 = 92$.
    *   Cross-operation: $104 - 2 = 102$ (or $98 + 4 = 102$). 
    *   Subtract 1: $102 - 1 = 101$. 
    *   *Result:* $10192$. 
*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $107 \times 93$
    *   Differences from 100: $+7$, $-7$.
    *   Multiply differences: $7 \times (-7) = -49$. 
    *   Last two digits: $100 - 49 = 51$. 
    *   Cross-operation: $107 - 7 = 100$ (or $93 + 7 = 100$). 
    *   Subtract 1: $100 - 1 = 99$. 
    *   *Result:* $9951$. 

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $105 \times 94$
    *   Differences from 100: $+5$, $-6$. 
    *   Multiply differences: $5 \times (-6) = -30$. 
    *   Last two digits: $100 - 30 = 70$. 
    *   Cross-operation: $105 - 6 = 99$ (or $94 + 5 = 99$).

1.  The tens digit of both numbers is the same.
2.  The sum of the units digits of both numbers is 10.

*How it works:*

1.  *Multiply the units digits:* Multiply the units digits of the two numbers. This will form the last two digits of your answer.
    *   **Important Note:** If the product of the units digits is a single digit (e.g., $1 \times 9 = 9$), write it as a two-digit number by adding a leading zero (e.g., 09). 

2.  *Multiply the tens digit by its next consecutive digit:* Take the common tens digit and multiply it by the next consecutive whole number. This will form the first part of your answer.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1: 67 x 63** 
    1.  Units digits: $7 \times 3 = 21$. 
    2.  Tens digit: The common tens digit is 6. The next consecutive digit is 7. So, $6 \times 7 = 42$. 
    *   *Result:* 4221 

*   **Example 2: 72 x 78** 
    1.  Units digits: $2 \times 8 = 16$.

##  Topic 14:  Multiplication: Difference 1 Model

This video introduces a quick multiplication trick for pairs of numbers that are equidistant from a "base" number (a multiple of 10). This method uses the algebraic identity $(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2$. 

*How it works:*

1.  *Identify the base number:* Find the multiple of 10 that lies exactly between the two numbers you want to multiply. This is your "base" number. 
    *   For example, between 19 and 21, the base is 20. 
    *   Between 39 and 41, the base is 40.

2.  *Square the base number:* Calculate the square of the base number. 

3.  *Subtract 1:* From the squared base number, subtract 1. This gives you the final product. 
    *   This works because the numbers can be expressed as (Base - 1) and (Base + 1).

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1: 19 x 21
    1.  Base number: 20 
    2.  Square of base: $20^2 = 400$. 
    3.  Subtract 1: $400 - 1 = 399$. 
    *   *Result:* 399 

*   **Example 2: 39 x 41** 
    1.  Base number: 40
    2.  Square of base: $40^2 = 1600$.
    3.  Subtract 1: $1600 - 1 = 1599$. 
    *   *Result:* 1599 

*   **Example 3: 29 x 31** 
    1.  Base number: 30 
    2.  Square of base: $30^2 = 900$.
    3.  Subtract 1: $900 - 1 = 899$. 
    *   *Result:* 899 

*   **Example 4: 49 x 51** 
    1.  Base number: 50 
    2.  Square of base: $50^2 = 2500$. 
    3.  Subtract 1: $2500 - 1 = 2499$. 
    *   *Result:* 2499 

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is highly efficient for mental calculations when the two numbers are consecutive odd or even numbers.
*   It simplifies multiplication by leveraging knowledge of squares of multiples of 10.
*   Practice squaring multiples of 10 to improve speed. 
##  Topic 15: Tricks of 9, 99, 999... Model 1

This video explains a multiplication trick for numbers multiplied by a sequence of nines (e.g., 9, 99, 999, etc.). This trick is applicable when the number of digits in the multiplicand (the first number) is equal to the number of nines in the multiplier (the second number). 

*How it works:*

1.  *Subtract 1 from the multiplicand:* Take the number being multiplied by the nines and subtract 1 from it. This forms the first part of your answer. 

2.  *Subtract digits from 9 or 10:* For the second part of your answer, go digit by digit through the *original multiplicand*.
    *   Subtract the last digit of the multiplicand from 10.
    *   Subtract all other digits of the multiplicand from 9. 

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1: 34 x 99** 
    1.  Subtract 1 from 34: $34 - 1 = 33$. 
    2.  Subtract digits:
        *   Last digit (4) from 10: $10 - 4 = 6$. 
        *   Other digit (3) from 9: $9 - 3 = 6$. 
    *   *Result:* 3366 

*   **Example 2: 234 x 999** 
    1.  Subtract 1 from 234: $234 - 1 = 233$. 
    2.  Subtract digits:
        *   Last digit (4) from 10: $10 - 4 = 6$. 
       *   Other digits from 9: $9 - 2 = 7$, $9 - 3 = 6$. 
    *   *Result:* 233766 

*   **Example 3: 3567 x 9999** 
    1.  Subtract 1 from 3567: $3567 - 1 = 3566$. 
    2.  Subtract digits:
        *   Last digit (7) from 10: $10 - 7 = 3$. 
        *   Other digits from 9: $9 - 3 = 6$, $9 - 5 = 4$, $9 - 6 = 3$.
    *   *Result:* 35666433 

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is a powerful shortcut for multiplication by numbers consisting solely of nines, provided the number of digits matches.
*   Remember the rule for subtracting: 10 for the last digit, 9 for all others. 
*   Consistent practice is essential to master this technique for quick mental calculations. 


## Trick for Multiplying by Numbers Consisting Only of Nines (Model 3)

This trick provides a shortcut for multiplying a number by a sequence of nines (e.g., 99, 9), especially when the number being multiplied has more digits than the sequence of nines.

*How it works:*

1.  **Identify the "nines part" and the "non-nines part":** In the number being multiplied, separate the digits that align with the "nines" (from the right) and the remaining digits to the left.
    *   Example: For `2749 x 99`:
        *   "Nines part" (corresponding to `99`): `49`
        *   "Non-nines part": `27`
    *   Example: For `245 x 9`:
        *   "Nines part" (corresponding to `9`): `5`
        *   "Non-nines part": `24`
    *   Example: For `14567 x 999`:
        *   "Nines part" (corresponding to `999`): `567`
        *   "Non-nines part": `14`

2.  **Calculate the "right-side" result:**
    *   For the digits in the "nines part" (identified in step 1), subtract each digit from 9, except for the last digit, which is subtracted from 10.
    *   Example: For `2749 x 99`, "nines part" is `49`:
        *   $9 - 4 = 5$
        *   $10 - 9 = 1$
        *   Result: `51` 
    *   Example: For `245 x 9`, "nines part" is `5`:
        *   $10 - 5 = 5$
        *   Result: `5` 
    *   Example: For `14567 x 999`, "nines part" is `567`:
        *   $9 - 5 = 4$
        *   $9 - 6 = 3$
        *   $10 - 7 = 3$
        *   Result: `433` 

3.  **Calculate the "left-side" result:**
    *   Take the entire number being multiplied (e.g., `2749`).
    *   Identify the "non-nines part" (from step 1, e.g., `27`).
    *   Add 1 to the "non-nines part" (e.g., `27 + 1 = 28`).
    *   Subtract this incremented value from the entire number (e.g., `2749 - 28`).
    *   This result forms the first part of your answer.

    *   Example: For `2749 x 99`:
        *   Entire number: `2749`
        *   "Non-nines part": `27`
        *   `27 + 1 = 28`
        *   `2749 - 28 = 2721` 
    *   Example: For `245 x 9`:
        *   Entire number: `245`
        *   "Non-nines part": `24`
        *   `24 + 1 = 25`
        *   `245 - 25 = 220` 
    *   Example: For `14567 x 999`:
        *   Entire number: `14567`
        *   "Non-nines part": `14`
        *   `14 + 1 = 15`
        *   `14567 - 15 = 14552` 

4.  **Combine the parts:** Concatenate the "left-side" result (from step 3) and the "right-side" result (from step 2).

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Problem:** `2749 x 99`
    1.  "Nines part": `49`. "Non-nines part": `27`.
    2.  Right-side calculation:
        *   $9 - 4 = 5$
        *   $10 - 9 = 1$
        *   Result: `51`
    3.  Left-side calculation:
        *   `27 + 1 = 28`
        *   `2749 - 28 = 2721`
    4.  Combine: `2721` + `51` = `272151`. 

*   **Problem:** `245 x 9`
    1.  "Nines part": `5`. "Non-nines part": `24`.
    2.  Right-side calculation:
        *   $10 - 5 = 5$
        *   Result: `5`
    3.  Left-side calculation:
        *   `24 + 1 = 25`
        *   `245 - 25 = 220`
    4.  Combine: `220` + `5` = `2205`. 

*   **Problem:** `14567 x 999`
    1.  "Nines part": `567`. "Non-nines part": `14`.
    2.  Right-side calculation:
        *   $9 - 5 = 4$
        *   $9 - 6 = 3$
        *   $10 - 7 = 3$
        *   Result: `433`
    3.  Left-side calculation:
        *   `14 + 1 = 15`
        *   `14567 - 15 = 14552`
    4.  Combine: `14552` + `433` = `14552433`. 

*Key Points:*
*   This trick is for cases where the number being multiplied has more digits than the sequence of nines.
*   It involves separating the multiplicand into two parts based on the number of nines.
*   Practice is key to mastering this method.
## Trick for Multiplying by Nines (Model - 2)

This trick provides a shortcut for multiplying a number by a sequence of nines (e.g., 9999, 99999), where the number of nines is greater than the number of digits in the multiplicand.

*How it works:*

1.  **Adjust the multiplicand:** Subtract 1 from the number being multiplied by the nines. This will form the first part of your answer.

2.  **Determine the number of "middle nines":** Count the number of nines in the multiplier. Count the number of digits in the original multiplicand. The difference between these two counts will be the number of nines to place in the middle of your answer.

3.  **Calculate the complement:** For each digit in the original multiplicand (starting from the left, excluding the last digit), subtract it from 9. For the last digit of the original multiplicand, subtract it from 10. These results will form the last part of your answer.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1: 9999 x 24**

    1.  **Adjust the multiplicand:** $24 - 1 = 23$

    2.  **Determine the number of "middle nines":**
        *   Number of nines in 9999: 4
        *   Number of digits in 24: 2
        *   Difference: $4 - 2 = 2$ (so, two '9's will be in the middle)

    3.  **Calculate the complement:**
        *   $9 - 2 = 7$
        *   $10 - 4 = 6$
        *   *Result:* $23\textbf{99}76$

*   **Example 2: 99999 x 345**

    1.  **Adjust the multiplicand:** $345 - 1 = 344$

    2.  **Determine the number of "middle nines":**
        *   Number of nines in 99999: 5
        *   Number of digits in 345: 3
        *   Difference: $5 - 3 = 2$ (so, two '9's will be in the middle)

    3.  **Calculate the complement:**
        *   $9 - 3 = 6$
        *   $9 - 4 = 5$
        *   $10 - 5 = 5$
        *   *Result:* $344\textbf{99}655$

*   **Example 3: 9999 x 146**

    1.  **Adjust the multiplicand:** $146 - 1 = 145$

    2.  **Determine the number of "middle nines":**
        *   Number of nines in 9999: 4
        *   Number of digits in 146: 3
        *   Difference: $4 - 3 = 1$ (so, one '9' will be in the middle)

    3.  **Calculate the complement:**
        *   $9 - 1 = 8$
        *   $9 - 4 = 5$
        *   $10 - 6 = 4$
        *   *Result:* $145\textbf{9}854$

## VEDIC MATHS




##   Topic 17:  "Sisya-te Sesa-samjnah" (Numbers near a Base)

The user wants me to extract information about multiplication tricks from the video, following the provided schema. The video demonstrates a Vedic Math trick called "Sisya-te Sesa-samjnah" which involves multiplying numbers close to a base (like 100).

Here's the information extracted from the video:
This Vedic Math trick provides a shortcut for multiplying two numbers that are close to a common base (e.g., 100, 1000). The specific examples in the video use 100 as the base. "Sisya-te Sesa-samjnah" translates to "The remainders by the last digit". 

*How it works (for numbers above 100, using 100 as the base):*

1.  *Identify the "remainders" (excess above the base):* For each number, find how much it is greater than the base (100 in these examples). 
    *   Example: For $104 \times 101$, the remainders are $4$ and $1$. 
2.  *Multiply the remainders:* Multiply these two remainder values. This product forms the rightmost part of the answer. Ensure this part has two digits (for a base of 100); add a leading zero if necessary. 
3.  *Cross-add:* Take one of the original numbers and add the remainder of the *other* number. (For example, add the first number to the second remainder, or the second number to the first remainder). Both cross-additions will yield the same result. This sum forms the leftmost part of the answer. 

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $$ 104 \times 101 $$ 
    *   Remainders (excess above 100): $4$ and $1$. 
    *   Multiply remainders: $4 \times 1 = 4$. Written as two digits: $04$. 
    *   Cross-add: $104 + 1 = 105$ (or $101 + 4 = 105$).
    *   *Result:* $$ 10504 $$

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $$ 108 \times 102 $$
    *   Remainders (excess above 100): $8$ and $2$. 
    *   Multiply remainders: $8 \times 2 = 16$. 
    *   Cross-add: $108 + 2 = 110$ (or $102 + 8 = 110$).
    *   *Result:* $$ 11016 $$ 

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $$ 106 \times 103 $$ 
    *   Remainders (excess above 100): $6$ and $3$. 
    *   Multiply remainders: $6 \times 3 = 18$. 
    *   Cross-add: $106 + 3 = 109$ (or $103 + 6 = 109$). 
    *   *Result:* $$ 10918 $$ 

*Key Points:*

*   This method is particularly efficient for multiplying numbers that are slightly above a power of ten (the base).
*   The "remainder" refers to the difference between the number and the chosen base.
*   The number of digits in the product of the remainders should match the number of zeros in the base (e.g., two digits for base 100). 
*   While other speed math methods exist, this trick offers a quick way to solve these specific types of multiplication problems. 

The user wants me to extract information about a Vedic Math trick called "Yavadunam Tavadunikrtya Varganca Yojayet" from the video, following the provided schema. This trick is used for squaring numbers.

Here's the information extracted from the video:

##  Topic 18: "Yavadunam Tavadunikrtya Varganca Yojayet"

This Vedic Math sutra provides a shortcut for squaring numbers, particularly those close to a base (like 10, 100, 1000, etc.). 

The meaning of the sutra is: "Whatever the deficiency, subtract that deficit from the number, and write alongside the square of that deficit."  This principle also applies to numbers that are in surplus of the base. 

*How it works:*

1.  **Choose a Base:** Identify a convenient base (e.g., 10, 100, 400) close to the number you want to square. 
2.  **Find the Deficiency or Surplus (Deficit):** Calculate the difference between the number and the chosen base. This can be a "deficiency" (if the number is less than the base) or a "surplus" (if the number is greater than the base).
3.  **Square the Deficit:** Square the deficiency or surplus amount. This will form the rightmost part of your answer. Ensure the number of digits in this part matches the number of zeros in your chosen base (e.g., two digits for base 100, one for base 10). If the square has more digits, carry over the extra digits to the left side.
4.  **Adjust the Number:**
    *   If there was a *surplus*, add the surplus amount to the original number. This forms the leftmost part of your answer. 
    *   If there was a *deficiency*, subtract the deficiency amount from the original number. This forms the leftmost part of your answer.
5.  **Combine and Adjust (if necessary):** Combine the two parts. If there were carried-over digits from step 3, add them to the leftmost part. If you used a base like 400 (which is $4 \times 100$), you multiply the leftmost part by 4 before combining.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1: Squaring 13*
    *   Problem: $$ 13^2 $$ 
    *   Base: 10. 
    *   Surplus (excess above 10): $3$.
    *   Adjust the number: $13 + 3 = 16$. 
    *   Square the surplus: $3^2 = 9$. 
    *   *Result:* $$ 169 $$

*   *Example 2: Squaring 114*
    *   Problem: $$ 114^2 $$
    *   Base: 100. 
    *   Surplus (excess above 100): $14$. 
    *   Adjust the number: $114 + 14 = 128$. 
    *   Square the surplus: $14^2 = 196$. 
    *   Combine and Adjust: The '1' from '196' is carried over. Add it to '128' to get '129'.
    *   *Result:* $$ 12996 $$

*   *Example 3: Squaring 375*
    *   Problem: $$ 375^2 $$
    *   Base: 400.
    *   Deficiency (less than 400): $25$. 
    *   Adjust the number: $375 - 25 = 350$. 
    *   Multiply by factor of base: Since the base is 400 (which is $4 \times 100$), multiply $350 \times 4 = 1400$. 
    *   Square the deficiency: $25^2 = 625$. 
    *   Combine and Adjust: Add the '6' from '625' to '1400' (the leftmost part of the answer before the final combination). This gives $1400 + 6 = 1406$.
    *   *Result:* $$ 140625 $$ [

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is suitable for finding the squares of numbers near a base, simplifying the calculation. 
*   The choice of base is important; it should be a multiple of 10 for ease of calculation (e.g., 10, 100, 200, 300, etc.).
*   Remember to manage the number of digits when writing the square of the deficit/surplus, carrying over when necessary. 
*   If the chosen base is a multiple of a power of ten (e.g., 400 is $4 \times 100$), multiply the adjusted number by that multiple before combining with the squared deficit/surplus. 
## Topic 19:  Anurupyeṇa 

The Upa-Sutra "anurupyeṇa" means "proportionality". This Sutra is highly useful for finding the products of two numbers when both of them are near the common bases, i.e., powers of base 10. This method is particularly helpful for numbers close to powers of 10 like 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and so on.

*How it works (for numbers near multiples of 10):*

1.  **Identify the base:** Determine the nearest multiple of 10 (e.g., 50, 40) to the numbers being multiplied.
2.  **Find the differences:** Calculate the difference between each number and the chosen base. Note these as positive or negative.
3.  **Multiply the differences:** Multiply the two differences obtained in step 2. This forms the right part of the answer.
4.  **Cross-subtract:** Subtract the difference of one number from the other number (crosswise). This forms the left part of the answer.
5.  **Adjust for the base (if not 10 or 100):**
    *   If the base is 50 (i.e., 5 x 10), take half of the result from step 4.
    *   If the base is 40 (i.e., 4 x 10), multiply the result from step 4 by 4.
    *   If the base is 70, multiply by 7, and so on.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1: 46 x 43** 
    *   **Base:** 50
    *   **Differences:**
        *   46 is 4 less than 50 ( -4 )
        *   43 is 7 less than 50 ( -7 )
    *   **Multiply differences:** $(-4) \times (-7) = 28$. Write down "28".
    *   **Cross-subtract:** $46 - 7 = 39$ (or $43 - 4 = 39$). 
    *   **Adjust for base 50:** Since the base is 50, take half of 39. $39 / 2 = 19.5$. 
    *   **Combine:** Add 19 (from 19.5) to the left part and combine the 0.5 with 28.
    *   *Result:* 1978. 

*   **Example 2: 42 x 48** 
    *   **Base:** 50
    *   **Differences:**
        *   42 is 8 less than 50 ( -8 )
        *   48 is 2 less than 50 ( -2 ) 
    *   **Multiply differences:** $(-8) \times (-2) = 16$. Write down "16". 
    *   **Cross-subtract:** $42 - 2 = 40$ (or $48 - 8 = 40$).
    *   **Adjust for base 50:** Take half of 40. $40 / 2 = 20$. 
    *   **Combine:** Write down 20 on the left side of 16.
    *   *Result:* 2016. 

*   **Example 3: 37 x 36** 
    *   **Base:** 40
    *   **Differences:**
        *   37 is 3 less than 40 ( -3 )
        *   36 is 4 less than 40 ( -4 )
    *   **Multiply differences:** $(-3) \times (-4) = 12$. Write down "12". 
    *   **Cross-subtract:** $37 - 4 = 33$ (or $36 - 3 = 33$). 
    *   **Adjust for base 40:** Since the base is 40, multiply 33 by 4. $33 \times 4 = 132$. 
    *   **Combine:** Write down 13 (from 132) and add 2 (from 132) to the carry-over from 12.
    *   *Result:* 1332. 

##  Topic 20 : Division  Nikhilam Method

The Nikhilam method is a Vedic mathematics technique used for division, particularly effective for divisors close to powers of 10 (like 10, 100, 1000, etc.).

*How it works:*

1.  **Set up the problem:**
    *   Write the divisor and then its "Nikhilam" (complement from the nearest power of 10).
    *   Separate the dividend into two parts with a vertical line: the right part having the same number of digits as the number of digits in the Nikhilam of the divisor, and the left part containing the remaining digits.

2.  **Perform the division:**
    *   Bring down the first digit of the left part of the dividend as the first digit of the quotient.
    *   Multiply this quotient digit by the Nikhilam and write the product below the subsequent digits of the dividend, shifting one place to the right.
    *   Add the numbers in the next column. This sum becomes the next digit of the quotient.
    *   Repeat the multiplication and addition steps until all digits in the left part of the dividend have been processed. The last sum in the left part is the final digit of the quotient.
    *   Continue multiplying the last quotient digit by the Nikhilam and adding to the digits in the right part of the dividend. The sum of the numbers in the right part is the remainder.

3.  **Check the remainder:**
    *   If the remainder is greater than or equal to the divisor, divide the remainder by the divisor. Add the quotient from this step to the main quotient and the new remainder is the final remainder.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1: Dividing 1111 by 89**

    *   **Step 1: Set up the problem.**
        *   Divisor = 89.
        *   Nearest power of 10 is 100.
        *   Nikhilam of 89 = $100 - 89 = 11$.
        *   Dividend = 1111. Since the Nikhilam (11) has two digits, separate the last two digits of the dividend.

            ```
            89 | 11 | 11
               |____|____
               | 1  |
            ```
        *   Multiply the quotient digit (1) by the Nikhilam (11) -> $1 \times 11 = 11$. Write "11" below "11" starting from the next column.
            ```
            89 | 11 | 11
               |    | 11
               |____|____
               | 1  |
            ```
        *   Add the numbers in the next column ($1+1=2$). This is the next quotient digit.
            ```
            89 | 11 | 11
               |    | 11
               |____|____
               | 1 2|
            ```
        *   Multiply the new quotient digit (2) by the Nikhilam (11) -> $2 \times 11 = 22$. Write "22" below "11" starting from the next available position.
            ```
            89 | 11 | 11
               |    | 11
               |    |   22
               |____|____
               | 1 2|
            ```
        *   Add the numbers in the right part for the remainder.
            *   Last column: $1+2 = 3$
            *   Second to last column: $1+1+2 = 4$
            ```
            89 | 11 | 11
               |    | 11
               |    |   22
               |____|____
               | 1 2| 43
            ```

        *   Nikhilam of 73 = $100 - 73 = 27$.
        *   Dividend = 111. Since the Nikhilam (27) has two digits, separate the last two digits of the dividend.

## Topic 21: Division (Anantyor Dasakepi)

This trick is a Vedic Math method for performing division, particularly useful for visualising steps. The term "Dasakepi" means "ending with 10", referring to the method's use of a complement to 10 for the divisor.

**How it Works (General Steps):**

1.  **Write the Dividend and Divisor's Complement:**
    *   Write the dividend (the number being divided) as individual digits.
    *   Draw a vertical line to separate the dividend from the divisor.
    *   To the right of the vertical line, write the "Anantyor Dasakepi" (complement to 10) of the divisor. This is the number that, when added to the last digit of the divisor, equals 10.
        *   Example: If the divisor is 8, its complement is 2 (since 8 + 2 = 10). If the divisor is 7, its complement is 3 (since 7 + 3 = 10). If the divisor is 6, its complement is 4 (since 6 + 4 = 10).

2.  **Draw a Horizontal Line:** Draw a horizontal line below the dividend and divisor's complement. This line will separate the intermediate calculations from the final quotient and remainder.

3.  **Bring Down the First Digit:** Bring down the first digit of the dividend below the horizontal line. This is the first digit of your provisional quotient.

4.  **Multiply and Add (Iterative Process):**
    *   Multiply the provisional quotient digit by the divisor's complement.
    *   Write this product below the next digit of the dividend.
    *   Add the current dividend digit and the product.
    *   If this sum is greater than or equal to the original divisor, divide it by the divisor. The quotient from this division is added to the previous provisional quotient digit, and the remainder is carried forward.
    *   If the sum is less than the original divisor, just write the sum below the line. This sum becomes the next provisional quotient digit.
    *   Repeat this process for each subsequent digit of the dividend.

5.  **Identify the Final Quotient and Remainder:**
    *   The numbers written below the horizontal line, excluding the last digit(s) (which form the final remainder), make up the quotient.
    *   The last digit(s) below the line, after all calculations, represent the remainder.

**Examples from the Video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: Divide 316 by 8**
    1.  **Dividend and Divisor's Complement:**
        *   Dividend: 3 1 6
        *   Divisor: 8
        *   Complement of 8: 2 (since 8 + 2 = 10)
        *   Setup: `8 | 3 1 6 | 2`

    2.  **Bring Down First Digit:**
        *   `3` (first digit of the dividend) is brought down.
        *   `8 | 3 1 6 | 2`
        *   `----`
        *   `3`

    3.  **Multiply and Add (Step 1):**
        *   Multiply 3 (provisional quotient) by 2 (complement): $3 \times 2 = 6$.
        *   Write 6 below the next digit of the dividend (1).
        *   Add 6 and 1: $6 + 1 = 7$.
        *   Setup: `8 | 3 1 6 | 2`
        *   `      6`
        *   `----`
        *   `3 7`

    4.  **Multiply and Add (Step 2):**
        *   Multiply 7 (new provisional quotient digit) by 2 (complement): $7 \times 2 = 14$.
        *   Write 14 below the next digit of the dividend (6).
        *   Add 14 and 6: $14 + 6 = 20$.
        *   Since 20 is greater than 8 (the divisor):
            *   Divide 20 by 8: $20 \div 8 = 2$ with a remainder of $4$.
            *   Add the quotient (2) to the previous provisional quotient digit (7): $7 + 2 = 9$.
            *   The remainder (4) becomes the last digit of the final result.
        *   Setup: `8 | 3 1 6 | 2`
        *   `      6 14`
        *   `----`
        *   `3 7 20`
        *   *(Correction from video based on standard Anantyor Dasakepi for quotient/remainder handling):*
            *   The video shows 37 as quotient and 20 as remainder, which is incorrect as the remainder (20) is greater than the divisor (8). The process should continue if the "remainder" is greater than the divisor.
            *   Let's re-evaluate based on the correct handling:
                *   $3 \times 2 = 6$. Add to 1, result 7.
                *   `3` becomes the first digit of the quotient. (The video incorrectly keeps 3)
                *   Now consider 7. We can divide 7 by 8? No. So 7 is part of the quotient.
                *   Multiply 7 by 2 = 14. Add to 6. $14+6=20$.
                *   Divide 20 by 8: $20 = 2 \times 8 + 4$.
                *   The quotient 2 is carried and added to 7: $7+2=9$.
                *   The remainder 4 is the final remainder.
                *   This means the quotient would be 39 and the remainder 4.
            *   The video's displayed final answer for Q=37, R=20 seems to indicate that it stops when the *sum* (20) is produced, before actual division by 8. This is a common point of confusion if the method isn't fully explained with remainder handling at each step.
            *   **Let's follow the video's explicit steps, even if they lead to an "invalid" remainder (remainder > divisor):**
                *   `Q = 37`
                *   `R = 20`
                *   This implies that the result is 37 with 20 as the remainder. However, in standard division, the remainder must be less than the divisor. If you have a remainder of 20 when dividing by 8, you can divide further: $20 = 2 \times 8 + 4$. So you would add 2 to the quotient (37+2 = 39) and the final remainder would be 4.
                *   So $316 \div 8 = 39$ with a remainder of $4$. The video seems to be presenting a partial result before the final remainder adjustment.

*   **Example 2: Divide 675 by 7**
    1.  **Dividend and Divisor's Complement:**
        *   Dividend: 6 7 5
        *   Divisor: 7
        *   Complement of 7: 3 (since 7 + 3 = 10)
        *   Setup: `7 | 6 7 5 | 3`

    2.  **Bring Down First Digit:**
        *   `6` is brought down.
        *   `7 | 6 7 5 | 3`
        *   `----`
        *   `6`

    3.  **Multiply and Add (Step 1):**
        *   Multiply 6 by 3: $6 \times 3 = 18$.
        *   Add 18 and 7: $18 + 7 = 25$.
        *   Since 25 is greater than 7 (the divisor):
            *   Divide 25 by 7: $25 \div 7 = 3$ with a remainder of $4$.
            *   Add the quotient (3) to the previous provisional quotient digit (6): $6 + 3 = 9$.
            *   The remainder (4) is carried over to the next position.
        *   Setup: `7 | 6 7 5 | 3`
        *   `      18`
        *   `----`
        *   `6 3 4` (The 3 is added to the 6, and the 4 is the remainder from 25/7, written next to 3)

    4.  **Multiply and Add (Step 2):**
        *   Multiply 4 (the remainder from the previous step) by 3 (complement): $4 \times 3 = 12$.
        *   Add 12 and 5: $12 + 5 = 17$.
        *   Since 17 is greater than 7 (the divisor):
            *   Divide 17 by 7: $17 \div 7 = 2$ with a remainder of $3$.
            *   Add the quotient (2) to the last provisional quotient digit (already 9): $9 + 2 = 11$.
            *   The remainder (3) is the final remainder.
        *   Setup: `7 | 6 7 5 | 3`
        *   `      18 12`
        *   `----`
        *   `6 3 4 17`
        *   *(Again, adjusting based on correct remainder handling vs. video display):*
            *   The video shows 634 as intermediate, implying 6 for the first digit of quotient, 3 (from 25/7) added to that.
            *   Let's follow the video's output for `Q` and `R`:
                *   `Q = 96` (The first digit of the quotient is 6, and the 3 added to it makes 9. But 9 is the quotient from the *first* step, so it implies a combined digit).
                *   `R = 3`
                *   This means $675 \div 7 = 96$ with a remainder of $3$.
                *   Let's verify: $96 \times 7 = 672$. $672 + 3 = 675$. This is correct.
                *   The video's intermediate display is:
                    *   `6` (from bringing down)
                    *   `18` (from $6 \times 3$)
                    *   `25` (sum of $18+7$).
                    *   `25/7 = 3` (quotient) and `4` (remainder).
                    *   Add 3 to 6: `9`.
                    *   Write 4: `9 4`. This would be the "new" number.
                    *   `4 \times 3 = 12`. Add to 5: `17`.
                    *   `17/7 = 2` (quotient) and `3` (remainder).
                    *   Add 2 to 9: `11`.
                    *   Final remainder is 3.
                    *   So the quotient is 11, and the remainder is 3.
                    *   $675 \div 7 = 11$ remainder 3? No, $11 \times 7 = 77$.
                    *   The video's presentation of the intermediate quotient `634` (where 3 and 4 come from 25/7) and then adding `4+2` to form `96` is a condensed way of showing it.
                    *   The final result `Q=96, R=3` is correct, but the *visual* steps in the video require careful interpretation of how carries and sums are being managed to arrive at the quotient.

*   **Example 3: Divide 981 by 6**
    1.  **Dividend and Divisor's Complement:**
        *   Dividend: 9 8 1
        *   Divisor: 6
        *   Complement of 6: 4 (since 6 + 4 = 10)
        *   Setup: `6 | 9 8 1 | 4`

    2.  **Bring Down First Digit:**
        *   `9` is brought down.
        *   `6 | 9 8 1 | 4`
        *   `----`
        *   `9`

    3.  **Multiply and Add (Step 1):**
        *   Multiply 9 by 4: $9 \times 4 = 36$.
        *   Add 36 and 8: $36 + 8 = 44$.
        *   Since 44 is greater than 6 (the divisor):
            *   Divide 44 by 6: $44 \div 6 = 7$ with a remainder of $2$.
            *   Add the quotient (7) to the previous provisional quotient digit (9): $9 + 7 = 16$.
            *   The remainder (2) is carried over.
        *   Setup: `6 | 9 8 1 | 4`
        *   `      36`
        *   `----`
        *   `9 7 2` (Here, 7 is the quotient of 44/6 and 2 is the remainder, similar to Example 2.)

    4.  **Multiply and Add (Step 2):**
        *   Multiply 2 (the remainder from the previous step) by 4 (complement): $2 \times 4 = 8$.
        *   Add 8 and 1: $8 + 1 = 9$.
        *   Since 9 is greater than 6 (the divisor):
            *   Divide 9 by 6: $9 \div 6 = 1$ with a remainder of $3$.
            *   Add the quotient (1) to the last provisional quotient digit (which was 16): $16 + 1 = 17$.
            *   The remainder (3) is the final remainder.
        *   Setup: `6 | 9 8 1 | 4`
        *   `      36 8`
        *   `----`
        *   `9 7 2 9`
        *   *(Adjusting based on video's final `Q` and `R`):*
            *   The video shows `Q = 163`, `R = 3`.
            *   Let's verify: $163 \times 6 = 978$. $978 + 3 = 981$. This is correct.
            *   The video's presentation of combining the quotient digits from the division steps with the running sum is the core of this method.
                *   Initial `9`. $9/6 = 1$ rem $3$. (So first quotient digit is 1)
                *   Multiply rem $3$ by $4 = 12$. Add to next dividend digit $8: 12+8=20$.
                *   $20/6 = 3$ rem $2$. (Next quotient digit is 3)
                *   Current quotient is $13$.
                *   Multiply rem $2$ by $4 = 8$. Add to next dividend digit $1: 8+1=9$.
                *   $9/6 = 1$ rem $3$. (Next quotient digit is 1)
                *   Current quotient is $131$.
                *   Now the video shows `163`. This means the interpretation of carrying and summing the quotients is critical and differs slightly from the direct example application.
                *   The instructor sums $9+7=16$ (from previous step 1) and then adds 1 to 16 to get 163. The remainder from the last step is 3.

**Key Points:**

*   This Vedic Math technique, "Anantyor Dasakepi," provides an alternative method for division that involves working with the complement of the divisor.
*   The method is described as being useful for mental calculations and visualisation once practiced, as it breaks down the division into iterative multiplication and addition steps.
*   The video's presentation of the intermediate steps for combining quotients and remainders can be slightly confusing without a more detailed explanation of how these parts are consolidated into the final answer. It often relies on a more mental "running total" or cumulative quotient.
*   It's emphasized that practice is key to mastering this method and achieving speed.
*   The overall message is to explore different division techniques from Vedic Maths and adopt the one that feels most intuitive and efficient for individual learners.

##  Topic 22 : Division Sisyate Sesamjnah method

This Vedic math trick, called "Sisyate Sesamjnah," can be used to perform division with remainders, especially when the divisor is a power of another number (or can be factored into such numbers).

**Key Idea:** The divisor is broken down into its prime factors (or other factors). The division is then performed in stages using these factors. The remainder is calculated based on these individual remainders.

**Steps:**

1.  **Factorize the Divisor:** Express the divisor (the number by which you are dividing) as a product of simpler factors. It's often helpful if these factors are small or powers of a number.
    *   Example: For division by 27, we can write $27 = 3^3 = 9 \times 3$.
    *   Example: For division by 64, we can write $64 = 4^3 = 16 \times 4$.

2.  **Perform First Division:** Divide the original dividend by the largest factor you found in step 1. Record the quotient (Q) and the remainder (R).
    *   Use mental math or a single-digit division trick (as mentioned in the video, "speed math" for single-digit division is helpful here).

3.  **Perform Second Division (on the first quotient):** Take the quotient from the first division (Q1) and divide it by the next factor from step 1. Record this new quotient (Q2) and its remainder (R2).

4.  **Construct the Final Quotient and Remainder:**
    *   The **final quotient** (Q) is the quotient from the last division (Q2).
    *   The **final remainder** (R) is calculated using the following formula:
        $$ \text{Final Remainder} = \left( R_1 \times \text{Second Divisor} \right) + R_2 $$
        Where:
        *   $R_1$ is the remainder from the first division.
        *   "Second Divisor" is the factor used in the second division.
        *   $R_2$ is the remainder from the second division.
    *   The overall division result is expressed as $Q \frac{R}{\text{Original Divisor}}$.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: Divide 3046 by 27**
    1.  **Factorize Divisor:** $27 = 9 \times 3$ (We'll divide by 9 first, then by 3).
    2.  **First Division (by 9):**
        *   $3046 \div 9$
        *   $Q_1 = 338$
        *   $R_1 = 4$
        (From the video: 30 in 9 goes 3 times (27), remainder 3. Bring down 4, becomes 34. 34 in 9 goes 3 times (27), remainder 7. Bring down 6, becomes 76. 76 in 9 goes 8 times (72), remainder 4.)
    3.  **Second Division (by 3):**
        *   $338 \div 3$
        *   $Q_2 = 112$
        *   $R_2 = 2$
        (From the video: 3 in 3 goes 1 time, remainder 0. Bring down 3, becomes 3. 3 in 3 goes 1 time, remainder 0. Bring down 8, becomes 8. 8 in 3 goes 2 times (6), remainder 2.)
    4.  **Final Quotient and Remainder:**
        *   Final Quotient ($Q$) = $Q_2 = 112$
        *   Final Remainder ($R$) = $(R_1 \times 3) + R_2 = (4 \times 3) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14$
        *   Wait, the video calculates the remainder differently: $R = \frac{4}{27} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4 + (2 \times 9)}{27} = \frac{4 + 18}{27} = \frac{22}{27}$.
            The final remainder is **22**.
        *   *Result:* $112 \frac{22}{27}$. So, Quotient = 112, Remainder = 22.

*   **Example 2: Divide 6352 by 64**
    1.  **Factorize Divisor:** $64 = 16 \times 4$ (We'll divide by 16 first, then by 4).
    2.  **First Division (by 16):**
        *   $6352 \div 16$
        *   $Q_1 = 397$
        *   $R_1 = 0$
        (From the video: 63 in 16 goes 3 times (48), remainder 15. Bring down 5, becomes 155. 155 in 16 goes 9 times (144), remainder 11. Bring down 2, becomes 112. 112 in 16 goes 7 times (112), remainder 0.)
    3.  **Second Division (by 4):**
        *   $397 \div 4$
        *   $Q_2 = 99$
        *   $R_2 = 1$
        (From the video: 39 in 4 goes 9 times (36), remainder 3. Bring down 7, becomes 37. 37 in 4 goes 9 times (36), remainder 1.)
    4.  **Final Quotient and Remainder:**
        *   Final Quotient ($Q$) = $Q_2 = 99$
        *   Final Remainder ($R$) = $(R_1 \times 4) + R_2 = (0 \times 4) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$
        *   Again, the video uses the fraction method for remainder: $R = \frac{0}{64} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{0 + (1 \times 16)}{64} = \frac{16}{64}$.
            The final remainder is **16**.
        *   *Result:* $99 \frac{16}{64}$. So, Quotient = 99, Remainder = 16.

**Correction/Clarification of Remainder Calculation:**

It seems the video is combining the remainders in a fractional form, where the final mixed fraction represents the quotient and the remainder over the original divisor.
The general formula for the final remainder when dividing by $D_1 \times D_2$ and obtaining $Q_1, R_1$ (from $D_1$) and $Q_2, R_2$ (from $D_2$) is:
$Q = Q_2$
$R = R_1 + (D_1 \times R_2)$
However, the video implicitly uses the structure $Q_2 + \frac{R_1}{D_{\text{original}}} + \frac{R_2}{D_{\text{second factor}} \times D_{\text{original}}/D_{\text{second factor}}}$ which simplifies to $Q_2 + \frac{R_{\text{final}}}{D_{\text{original}}}$.

Let's re-examine the remainder calculation shown in the video for clarity:
When you have:
$Q_2$ (final quotient)
$R_1$ (remainder from dividing by $D_1$)
$R_2$ (remainder from dividing $Q_1$ by $D_2$)
And the original divisor is $D_{\text{original}} = D_1 \times D_2$.

The final result is $Q_2 + \left( \frac{R_1}{D_{\text{original}}} + \frac{R_2}{D_2 \times (D_{\text{original}}/D_2)} \right)$
This is essentially $Q_2 + \frac{R_1}{D_{\text{original}}} + \frac{R_2}{D_1 \times D_2}$ which simplifies to $Q_2 + \frac{R_1 + (R_2 \times D_1)}{D_{\text{original}}}$.

So, the **correct final remainder (R) calculation** based on the video's presentation is:
$$ \text{Final Remainder} = R_1 + (R_2 \times D_1) $$
Where:
*   $R_1$ is the remainder from the first division (by $D_1$).
*   $R_2$ is the remainder from the second division (by $D_2$).
*   $D_1$ is the first divisor (the larger factor).

Let's re-apply this to the examples:

*   **Example 1:** $D_{\text{original}}=27$, $D_1=9$, $D_2=3$.
    *   $R_1=4$
    *   $R_2=2$
    *   Final Remainder = $R_1 + (R_2 \times D_1) = 4 + (2 \times 9) = 4 + 18 = 22$.
    *   This matches the video's final remainder.

*   **Example 2:** $D_{\text{original}}=64$, $D_1=16$, $D_2=4$.
    *   $R_1=0$
    *   $R_2=1$
    *   Final Remainder = $R_1 + (R_2 \times D_1) = 0 + (1 \times 16) = 16$.
    *   This matches the video's final remainder.

**Conclusion:**

This method is efficient for divisions where the divisor can be factored into powers or simpler numbers. It leverages repeated division by smaller factors to arrive at the final quotient and remainder. Mastering single-digit division greatly enhances the speed of this trick.

## MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS

##  Topic 23:  Number Series - 1

This section discusses common patterns found in number series problems often seen in competitive exams like UPSC, PSC, and Olympiads. The key is to practice different types of series to quickly identify the underlying pattern.

### Pattern 1: Alternate Series (Counting Numbers)

*   **Description:** In this type of series, numbers might increase or decrease in an alternating pattern, often skipping one number in between. To solve it, analyze the relationship between alternate numbers.
*   **Example from the video:**
    *   **Series:** 7, 10, 8, 11, 9, 12, ...
    *   **Goal:** Find the next number in the series.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   Look at the alternate numbers starting from the first: 7, 8, 9, ...
        *   This sequence is simply counting up by 1.
        *   Therefore, the next number in this alternate sequence would be 10.
    *   **Solution:** The next number is **10**.

### Pattern 2: Consecutive Differences (Paired Subtraction)

*   **Description:** This pattern involves a consistent operation (like subtraction) applied to pairs of numbers, which are then often repeated.
*   **Example from the video:**
    *   **Series:** 53, 53, 40, 40, 27, 27, ...
    *   **Goal:** Find the next number in the series.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   Observe the pairing: (53, 53), (40, 40), (27, 27). Each number appears twice.
        *   Now, look at the transition between the distinct numbers:
            *   From 53 to 40: $53 - 40 = 13$. So, $53 - 13 = 40$.
            *   From 40 to 27: $40 - 27 = 13$. So, $40 - 13 = 27$.
        *   The pattern is to subtract 13 and then repeat the result.
    *   **Solution:** Following the pattern, the next step is to subtract 13 from 27: $27 - 13 = 14$. The next number is **14**.

### Pattern 3: Fibonacci-like Series (Sum of Previous Two)

*   **Description:** In this series, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. This is a classic Fibonacci sequence or a variation of it.
*   **Example from the video:**
    *   **Series:** 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
    *   **Goal:** Find the next number in the series.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   The first two numbers are given (0, 1).
        *   The third number is the sum of the first two: $0 + 1 = 1$.
        *   The fourth number is the sum of the second and third: $1 + 1 = 2$.
        *   The fifth number is the sum of the third and fourth: $1 + 2 = 3$.
        *   The sixth number is the sum of the fourth and fifth: $2 + 3 = 5$.
        *   The seventh number is the sum of the fifth and sixth: $3 + 5 = 8$.
    *   **Solution:** To find the next number, sum the last two numbers: $5 + 8 = 13$. The next number is **13**.

### Pattern 4: Prime Numbers Series

*   **Description:** This series consists of consecutive prime numbers. Understanding prime numbers is crucial for recognizing this pattern. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
*   **Example from the video:**
    *   **Series:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...
    *   **Goal:** Find the next number in the series.
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   The numbers provided (2, 3, 5, 7, 11) are all prime numbers in ascending order.
    *   **Solution:** The next prime number after 11 is **13**.

*Key Points for Number Series:*

*   **Practice is crucial:** The more you practice, the faster you'll identify different patterns.
*   **Types of numbers:** Be familiar with various types of numbers (prime, composite, square, cube, perfect numbers, etc.).
*   **Common operations:** Look for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squares, cubes, and alternating patterns.
*   **Alternative thinking:** Sometimes the pattern might be between alternate numbers, not consecutive ones.
*   **Puzzles:** Number series can sometimes appear as puzzles.

##  Topic 24 : Number Series - Part 2

This video presents two types of number series problems: one with alternating elements and another with a constant difference or multiplier.

### Problem 1: Alternating Series

**Series:** 28, 25, 5, 21, 18, 5, 14, .....
**Options:** a. 11 5, b. 10 7, c. 11 8, d. 5 10, e. 10 5

*How to solve:*

1.  **Observe the pattern:** Notice that the number '5' appears periodically in the series. This suggests an alternating pattern where '5' is a recurring element.
2.  **Analyze the non-5 elements:**
    *   The first set of numbers is 28, 25. The difference is $28 - 25 = 3$.
    *   The second set of numbers is 21, 18. The difference is $21 - 18 = 3$.
    *   The third number in this sequence is 14.
3.  **Identify the rule for non-5 elements:** It appears that a specific number (3) is being subtracted from the first number of each pair, and '5' is inserted in between.
    *   $28 \rightarrow 28 - 3 = 25$ (followed by 5)
    *   $21 \rightarrow 21 - 3 = 18$ (followed by 5)
    *   $14 \rightarrow 14 - 3 = 11$
4.  **Determine the next terms:**
    *   Since the pattern is `(number - 3), 5`, after 14, the next number will be $14 - 3 = 11$.
    *   Following the pattern, the number after 11 will be 5.

**Answer:** The next two numbers in the series are 11 and 5.
**Option:** a. 11 5

### Problem 2: Arithmetic Progression

**Series:** 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 51...
**Options:** a. 59 66, b. 56 62, c. 58 66, d. 58 65, e. 54 61

*How to solve:*

1.  **Calculate the difference between consecutive terms:**
    *   $16 - 9 = 7$
    *   $23 - 16 = 7$
    *   $30 - 23 = 7$
    *   $37 - 30 = 7$
    *   $44 - 37 = 7$
    *   $51 - 44 = 7$
2.  **Identify the pattern:** The difference between consecutive terms is consistently 7. This indicates an arithmetic progression where 7 is added to each term to get the next.
3.  **Determine the next terms:**
    *   The next number after 51 will be $51 + 7 = 58$.
    *   The number after 58 will be $58 + 7 = 65$.

**Answer:** The next two numbers in the series are 58 and 65.
**Option:** d. 58 65

### Problem 3: Decimal Arithmetic Progression

**Series:** 1.5, 2.3, 3.1, 3.9, ... What number should come next?
**Options:** a. 4.2, b. 4.4, c. 4.7, d. 5.1

*How to solve:*

1.  **Calculate the difference between consecutive terms:**
    *   $2.3 - 1.5 = 0.8$
    *   $3.1 - 2.3 = 0.8$
    *   $3.9 - 3.1 = 0.8$
2.  **Identify the pattern:** The difference between consecutive terms is consistently 0.8. This indicates an arithmetic progression where 0.8 is added to each term to get the next.
3.  **Determine the next term:**
    *   The next number after 3.9 will be $3.9 + 0.8 = 4.7$.

**Answer:** The next number in the series is 4.7.
**Option:** c. 4.7

### Problem 4: Geometric Progression

**Series:** 2, 6, 18, 54, ... What number should come next?
**Options:** a. 108, b. 148, c. 162, d. 216

*How to solve:*

1.  **Analyze the relationship between terms:** Since the numbers are increasing rapidly, consider multiplication.
    *   $2 \times ? = 6 \implies ? = 3$
    *   $6 \times ? = 18 \implies ? = 3$
    *   $18 \times ? = 54 \implies ? = 3$
2.  **Identify the pattern:** Each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next term. This is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.
3.  **Determine the next term:**
    *   The next number after 54 will be $54 \times 3 = 162$.

**Answer:** The next number in the series is 162.
**Option:** c. 162

*Key Takeaways for Number Series:*

*   **Practice is key:** Solving many problems helps you quickly identify patterns.
*   **Look for differences:** For arithmetic series, check if a constant is being added or subtracted.
*   **Look for ratios:** For geometric series, check if a constant is being multiplied or divided.
*   **Look for alternating patterns:** Sometimes numbers or operations alternate.
*   **Consider squares, cubes, and other operations:** More complex series might involve powers or combinations of operations.
## Topic 25: Number Series - 3

This video covers three number series problems, demonstrating different patterns and approaches to finding the missing terms.

### Problem 1: Alternating Subtraction Pattern

*   **Series:** 42, 40, 38, 35, 33, 31, 28, \_, \_, \_
*   **Observation:** The series involves alternating subtractions of 2 and 3.
    *   $42 - 2 = 40$
    *   $40 - 2 = 38$
    *   $38 - 3 = 35$
    *   $35 - 2 = 33$
    *   $33 - 2 = 31$
    *   $31 - 3 = 28$
*   **Pattern:** The pattern of subtraction is (-2, -2, -3), which repeats.
*   **Finding the next terms:**
    *   Following the pattern, the next operation after -3 should be -2.
        *   $28 - 2 = 26$
    *   The next operation is again -2.
        *   $26 - 2 = 24$
    *   The next operation is -3.
        *   $24 - 3 = 21$
*   **Missing Terms:** 26, 24, 21
*   **Answer (from options):** The option containing "26, 24" (or similar sequence) is the correct one. In the video, option (c) "26, 24" is marked.

### Problem 2: Interleaved (Alternating) Series

*   **Series:** 8, 12, 9, 13, 10, 14, 11, \_, \_
*   **Observation:** This is an interleaved series, meaning there are two separate patterns running concurrently.
*   **Pattern 1 (Odd positions):** 8, 9, 10, 11, ...
    *   This sequence increases by 1 each time.
    *   The next term in this sequence would be $11 + 1 = 12$.
*   **Pattern 2 (Even positions):** 12, 13, 14, ...
    *   This sequence also increases by 1 each time.
    *   The next term in this sequence would be $14 + 1 = 15$.
*   **Missing Terms:** The missing terms are the next number in Pattern 2 (15) and the next number in Pattern 1 (12).
*   **Answer (from options):** The option containing "15, 12" is the correct one. In the video, option (b) "15, 12" is marked.

### Problem 3: Alternating Subtraction Pattern (with Options showing two numbers)

*   **Series:** 36, 31, 29, 24, 22, 17, 15
*   **Observation:** The options provided show pairs of numbers, suggesting that two numbers are missing from the end of the series, or that there's an alternating pattern involving two interleaved sequences. The video approaches it as finding two subsequent numbers in the main sequence.
*   **Analyzing the differences between consecutive terms:**
    *   $36 - 31 = 5$ (subtract 5)
    *   $31 - 29 = 2$ (subtract 2)
    *   $29 - 24 = 5$ (subtract 5)
    *   $24 - 22 = 2$ (subtract 2)
    *   $22 - 17 = 5$ (subtract 5)
    *   $17 - 15 = 2$ (subtract 2)
*   **Pattern:** The pattern of subtraction is (-5, -2), which repeats.
*   **Finding the next terms:**
    *   The last operation was -2 ($17 - 15 = 2$).
    *   Following the pattern, the next operation should be -5.
        *   $15 - 5 = 10$
    *   The next operation should be -2.
        *   $10 - 2 = 8$
*   **Missing Terms:** 10, 8
*   **Answer (from options):** The option containing "10, 8" is the correct one. In the video, option (e) "10, 8" is marked.

**Key Takeaways from the Video:**

*   Number series problems often involve identifying arithmetic progressions (addition/subtraction) or alternating patterns.
*   Sometimes, multiple patterns can be interleaved within a single series.
*   Paying attention to the structure of the options (e.g., single number vs. pairs) can give clues about the nature of the missing terms or the series pattern.
*   Practice is crucial to recognize different types of series patterns quickly.
## Topic 26:  Number Series - 4

This video presents four number series problems, demonstrating various patterns including arithmetic progressions, sequences involving decimals, and multiplication patterns.

### Problem 1: Arithmetic Progression with Increasing Common Difference (Multiples of 7)

*   **Series:** 21, 28, 42, 63, 81, ...
*   **Observation:** The differences between consecutive terms are increasing.
    *   $28 - 21 = 7$
    *   $42 - 28 = 14$
    *   $63 - 42 = 21$
    *   $81 - 63 = 28$
*   **Pattern:** The differences (7, 14, 21, 28) are multiples of 7. The next difference should be $7 \times 5 = 35$.
*   **Finding the next term:**
    *   Add 35 to the last term (81).
    *   $81 + 35 = 116$
*   **Next Term:** 116

### Problem 2: Adding Half of the Previous Term

*   **Series:** 2, 3, 4.5, 6.75, ...
*   **Observation:** The terms are increasing, and there are decimals, suggesting multiplication or addition involving fractions/decimals.
*   **Pattern:** Each term is obtained by adding half of the previous term to itself. This is equivalent to multiplying by 1.5.
    *   $2 + (2 / 2) = 2 + 1 = 3$ (or $2 \times 1.5 = 3$)
    *   $3 + (3 / 2) = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5$ (or $3 \times 1.5 = 4.5$)
    *   $4.5 + (4.5 / 2) = 4.5 + 2.25 = 6.75$ (or $4.5 \times 1.5 = 6.75$)
*   **Finding the next term:**
    *   Take the last term (6.75) and add half of it.
    *   $6.75 + (6.75 / 2) = 6.75 + 3.375 = 10.125$
    *   (Alternatively, $6.75 \times 1.5 = 10.125$)
*   **Next Term:** 10.125

### Problem 3: Multiplicative and Additive Pattern

*   **Series:** 0.5, 1, 2.5, 8, 32.5, ...
*   **Observation:** The terms are increasing, and the increments are not simple. The presence of .5 suggests operations involving .5.
*   **Pattern:** Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by an increasing integer, and then adding 0.5.
    *   $0.5 \times 1 + 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1$
    *   $1 \times 2 + 0.5 = 2 + 0.5 = 2.5$
    *   $2.5 \times 3 + 0.5 = 7.5 + 0.5 = 8$
    *   $8 \times 4 + 0.5 = 32 + 0.5 = 32.5$
*   **Finding the next term:**
    *   Following the pattern, multiply the last term by 5 and add 0.5.
    *   $32.5 \times 5 + 0.5 = 162.5 + 0.5 = 163$
*   **Next Term:** 163

### Problem 4: Division by 2 (or Multiplication by 0.5)

*   **Series:** 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, ...
*   **Observation:** The numbers are decreasing, and they are all powers of 0.5 (or fractions like 1/2, 1/4, 1/8).
*   **Pattern:** Each term is half of the previous term. This is equivalent to multiplying by 0.5 (or dividing by 2).
    *   $0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25$
    *   $0.25 \times 0.5 = 0.125$
*   **Finding the next term:**
    *   Multiply the last term (0.125) by 0.5.
    *   $0.125 \times 0.5 = 0.0625$
*   **Next Term:** 0.0625

**General Advice for Number Series (from the video):**

*   **Practice is key:** Solving many different types of problems helps in recognizing patterns faster.
*   **Decimal numbers:** If a series contains decimals like 0.5, consider multiplication or addition patterns involving 0.5 (e.g., multiplying by 0.5, adding 0.5, or adding half of the previous number).
*   **Look for common differences/ratios:** Start by checking simple arithmetic or geometric progressions.
*   **Table-based patterns:** Sometimes, the differences (or ratios) themselves form a recognizable sequence (like multiples of 7 in Problem 1).
*   **Interleaved series:** Be aware that a single series might consist of two or more independent sub-series.
## Topic 26: Number Series - 5

This video presents various types of number series problems, including arithmetic/geometric progressions, alphanumeric series, and basic ordering tasks.

### Problem 1: Half-Reduction Series

**Problem:** Look at this series: 664, 332, 340, 170, \_, 89, ...
What number should fill the blank?
a. 85 b. 97 c. 109 d. 178

**Explanation:**
The series follows a pattern of alternating division by 2 (halving) and addition/subtraction.

1.  **664 to 332:** $664 / 2 = 332$
2.  **332 to 340:** $332 + 8 = 340$
3.  **340 to 170:** $340 / 2 = 170$
4.  **170 to blank:** Following the pattern, the next step should be adding 8. So, $170 + 8 = 178$.
5.  **Blank (178) to 89:** This matches the next step of division by 2, as $178 / 2 = 89$.

**Solution:** The missing number is 178.
**Answer:** d. 178

### Problem 2: Alphanumeric Series

**Problem:** Look at this series: F2, \_\_\_, D8, C16, B32, ...
What number should fill the blank?
a. A16 b. G4 c. E4 d. E3

**Explanation:**
This series combines both alphabetical and numerical patterns.

**Numerical Pattern:**
Look at the numbers: 2, \_\_\_, 8, 16, 32.
This is a doubling pattern moving forward, or halving moving backward.
*   $16 \times 2 = 32$
*   $8 \times 2 = 16$
*   So, the number before 8 must be $8 / 2 = 4$.

**Alphabetical Pattern:**
Look at the letters: F, \_\_\_, D, C, B.
The letters are decreasing alphabetically (backward sequence).
*   F (6th letter)
*   D (4th letter)
*   C (3rd letter)
*   B (2nd letter)
*   Following the reverse alphabetical order, the letter before D would be E.

**Combining the patterns:**
The missing term should combine 'E' and '4'.

**Solution:** The missing term is E4.
**Answer:** c. E4

### Problem 3: Power Series (Multiplication)

**Problem:** Find the next number in the series: 3, 9, 27, 81, ?
a. 121 b. 162 c. 243 d. 154

**Explanation:**
This is a geometric series where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 3.
Alternatively, it's a series of powers of 3.

1.  **3:** $3^1$
2.  **9:** $3 \times 3 = 9$ (or $3^2$)
3.  **27:** $9 \times 3 = 27$ (or $3^3$)
4.  **81:** $27 \times 3 = 81$ (or $3^4$)
5.  **Next term:** $81 \times 3 = 243$ (or $3^5$)

This video shows how to handle data handling tables by providing examples.

## Topic 27: Tables in Data Handling

The video explains how to interpret data presented in tables, focusing on key terms like class intervals, frequency, lower limit, and upper limit.

### Key Concepts:

*   **Class Interval:** A range of values used to group data. For example, "0-5" represents a class interval.
*   **Frequency:** The number of times a particular value or range of values occurs in a dataset.
*   **Lower Limit:** The smallest value in a class interval. For a class interval "20-25", the lower limit is 20.
*   **Upper Limit:** The largest value in a class interval. For a class interval "20-25", the upper limit is 25.
*   **Size of Class Interval:** The difference between the upper limit and the lower limit of a class interval (Upper Limit - Lower Limit). All class intervals in a table should generally have the same size.

### Examples from the video (with solutions):

**Table Data:**

| Class Interval (height in cm) | Frequency |
| :---------------------------- | :-------- |
| 0 - 5                         | 2         |
| 5 - 10                        | 5         |
| 10 - 15                       | 10        |
| 15 - 20                       | 2         |
| 20 - 25                       | 20        |
| 25 - 30                       | 10        |
| 30 - 35                       | 50        |
| 35 - 40                       | 30        |

---

**I. What is the size of the class intervals?** (00:26)

*   **Explanation:** To find the size of the class interval, subtract the lower limit from the upper limit for any given interval.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   For "0-5": $5 - 0 = 5$
    *   For "5-10": $10 - 5 = 5$
    *   For "10-15": $15 - 10 = 5$
    *   All class intervals in this table have a consistent size.
*   **Answer:** The size of the class intervals is **5**.

---

**II. Which class interval has the highest frequency?** (01:30)

*   **Explanation:** Look at the "Frequency" column and identify the largest value. Then, find the corresponding "Class Interval".
*   **Answer:** The highest frequency is 50, which corresponds to the class interval **30-35**.
*   **Additional points:**
    *   The lowest frequency is 2, which corresponds to the class intervals "0-5" and "15-20".

---

**III. Which two classes have the same frequency?** (02:37)

*   **Explanation:** Scan the "Frequency" column for repeating values.
*   **Answer:**
    *   Frequency of **2**: Class intervals **0-5** and **15-20**.
    *   Frequency of **10**: Class intervals **10-15** and **25-30**.

---

**IV. How many students have height less than 36 cm?** (03:45)

*   **Explanation:** "Less than 36 cm" means we need to sum the frequencies of all class intervals where the upper limit is 35 or less.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Frequencies for class intervals up to 30-35: $2 + 5 + 10 + 2 + 20 + 10 + 50$
    *   Sum: $2 + 5 = 7$
    *   $7 + 10 = 17$
    *   $17 + 2 = 19$
    *   $19 + 20 = 39$
    *   $39 + 10 = 49$
    *   $49 + 50 = 99$
*   **Answer:** **99** students have a height less than 36 cm.

---

**V. What is the lower limit of the class interval 20-25?** (05:27)

*   **Explanation:** The lower limit is the first (smaller) value in a class interval.
*   **Answer:** For the class interval "20-25", the lower limit is **20**.
*   **Additional points:** The upper limit for this interval is 25.

## Topic 28:  Statements - Type 1

This video explains how to solve "Statements - Type 1" questions, which involve comparing individuals or objects based on characteristics like height, size, or other measurable attributes. The key is to visualize the relationships using simple line diagrams.

**Problem Statement:**

"Anil is taller than Sunny who is shorter than Baby. Anil is taller than Bose who is shorter than Sunny. Baby is shorter than Anil.
Who is the shortest?"

**Step-by-Step Solution Strategy:**

1.  **Visualize with Lines:** Draw vertical lines to represent the height of each person. A longer line indicates a taller person.

2.  **Process Each Statement Sequentially:**

    *   **"Anil is taller than Sunny..."**
        *   Draw a line for Anil.
        *   Draw a shorter line next to it for Sunny.
        *   (Anil | Sunny)

    *   **"...who is shorter than Baby."**
        *   The word "who" refers to Sunny. So, "Sunny is shorter than Baby."
        *   This means Baby is taller than Sunny.
        *   Update the arrangement: (Anil | Baby | Sunny)
        *   At this point, from the first sentence: Anil > Baby > Sunny. (This needs a correction in the visualization later as Baby is shown taller than Sunny but shorter than Anil).

    *   **"Anil is taller than Bose..."**
        *   Draw a new line for Anil.
        *   Draw a shorter line for Bose next to it.
        *   (Anil | Bose)

    *   **"...who is shorter than Sunny."**
        *   The word "who" refers to Bose. So, "Bose is shorter than Sunny."
        *   This means Sunny is taller than Bose.
        *   Update the arrangement for the second sentence's elements: (Anil | Sunny | Bose)

    *   **"Baby is shorter than Anil."**
        *   This confirms Anil is taller than Baby.

3.  **Combine the Information and Refine the Visualization:**

    Let's refine the line visualization by continuously adjusting based on all statements. The goal is to create a single, consistent height order.

    *   From "Anil is taller than Sunny who is shorter than Baby":
        *   Anil > Sunny
        *   Baby > Sunny
        *   So far: (Anil, Baby) > Sunny. We don't know the exact relationship between Anil and Baby yet from this part, only that Sunny is the shortest of these three.

    *   From "Anil is taller than Bose who is shorter than Sunny":
        *   Anil > Bose
        *   Sunny > Bose
        *   So far: Anil > Sunny > Bose.

    *   From "Baby is shorter than Anil":
        *   Anil > Baby

    Let's arrange them from tallest to shortest based on all combined information:

    *   Anil is the tallest among Anil, Sunny, Bose, and Baby based on "Anil is taller than Sunny" and "Anil is taller than Bose" and "Baby is shorter than Anil".
    *   Since "Sunny is shorter than Baby" and "Sunny is taller than Bose", we have Baby > Sunny > Bose.
    *   Combining with Anil being the tallest and Baby being shorter than Anil:
        *   Anil (Tallest)
        *   Baby
        *   Sunny
        *   Bose (Shortest)

    The combined order of height (from tallest to shortest) is:
    Anil > Baby > Sunny > Bose

4.  **Answer the Question:**

    The question asks: "Who is the shortest?"

    Based on the refined order, **Bose** is the shortest.

**Key Point for "who" in statements:**
When a statement says "Person A is [comparison] than Person B, who is [comparison] than Person C", the "who" refers to Person B (the person immediately preceding "who").
*   "Anil is taller than Sunny **who** is shorter than Baby."
    *   This means: Anil > Sunny AND Sunny < Baby (or Baby > Sunny).
*   "Anil is taller than Bose **who** is shorter than Sunny."
    *   This means: Anil > Bose AND Bose < Sunny (or Sunny > Bose).

This method of drawing lines and updating the order helps in visually tracking the relationships and avoiding confusion, especially with multiple comparisons.

## Topic 29:  Statement Type 2

This type of statement question involves scenarios where one item or concept is *called* another. The key is to first identify the true answer to the question and then find what that true answer is *called* in the provided statement.

*   **Problem:** If 'sky' is called 'star', 'star' is called 'cloud', 'cloud' is called 'earth', 'earth' is called 'tree' and 'tree' is called 'book', then where do the birds fly?

*   **How to solve:**
    1.  **Identify the real-world answer:** In reality, birds fly in the **sky**.
    2.  **Find what the real-world answer is called in the statement:** According to the statement, 'sky' is **called** 'star'.
    3.  **The coded answer:** Therefore, the birds fly in the **star**.

*   **Example from the video:**
    *   **Question:** Where do the birds fly?
    *   **Real Answer:** Sky 
    *   **Statement:** 'sky' is called 'star'.
    *   **Coded Answer:** Star
*   **Key Point:** When the phrasing is "A is **called** B", the answer is B if A is the true object.

## Topic 30:  Statement Type 3

This type of statement question involves scenarios where one item or concept *means* another. Similar to Type 2, the approach is to identify the true answer to the question and then find what that true answer *means* in the provided statement.

*   **Problem:** If white means black, black means red, red means yellow, yellow means orange, orange means green, green means violet and violet means blue, what is the colour of human blood?

*   **How to solve:**
    1.  **Identify the real-world answer:** In reality, the colour of human blood is **red**.
    2.  **Find what the real-world answer *means* in the statement:** According to the statement, 'red' **means** 'yellow'.
    3.  **The coded answer:** Therefore, the colour of human blood is **yellow**.

*   **Example from the video:**
    *   **Question:** What is the colour of human blood?
    *   **Real Answer:** Red 
    *   **Statement:** 'red' means 'yellow'.
    *   **Coded Answer:** Yellow 

*   **Key Point:** When the phrasing is "A **means** B", the answer is B if A is the true object.

These statement questions test your ability to follow given logical mappings rather than relying on real-world facts for the final answer. You must stick strictly to the definitions provided in the statement.

## Topic 31: What is the range?

Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It helps statisticians understand how varied the data set is.

Formula:
$$ \text{Range} = \text{Maximum Value} - \text{Minimum Value} $$

**Example 1:**

**Q:** Aji's family drove through 6 North Indian states during their summer vacation. CNG prices varied from state to state. What is the range of LPG prices?
**Data:** Rs. 756, Rs. 771, Rs. 796, Rs. 792, Rs. 784, Rs. 775

**Solution:**
1.  **Identify Maximum Value (M.V):** In the given data, the maximum value is 796.
2.  **Identify Minimum Value (Min.V):** In the given data, the minimum value is 756.
3.  **Calculate the Range:**
    $$ \text{Range} = \text{M.V} - \text{Min.V} $$
    $$ \text{Range} = 796 - 756 $$
    $$ \text{Range} = 40 $$
    The range of LPG prices is **40**.

**Example 2:**

**Q:** Consider the following dataset of exam scores for a class tenth:
**Data:** 63, 89, 92, 77, 72, 91, 82

Find the Range of the above data.

**Solution:**
1.  **Identify Maximum Value (M.V):** In the given data, the maximum value is 92.
2.  **Identify Minimum Value (Min.V):** In the given data, the minimum value is 63.
3.  **Calculate the Range:**
    $$ \text{Range} = \text{M.V} - \text{Min.V} $$
    $$ \text{Range} = 92 - 63 $$
    $$ \text{Range} = 29 $$
    The range of the exam scores is **29**.
## Topic 32:  Types of Fractions

This video explains various types of fractions, including their definitions and examples.

### I. Simple, Common, or Vulgar Fractions 

*   **Definition:** Any number that can be expressed as a numerator (top part) and a denominator (bottom part) where the denominator is not zero.
*   **Key Characteristic:** The denominator cannot be zero.
*   **Examples:**
    *   $5 = \frac{5}{1}$ (all whole numbers can be written as simple fractions with a denominator of 1)
    *   $\frac{1}{2}$
    *   $\frac{-8}{5}$
    *   $\frac{8}{-5}$ (negative signs can appear in the numerator or denominator)

*   **Key Characteristic:** The numerator is always 1.
*   **Examples:**
    *   $\frac{1}{7}$
    *   $\frac{1}{2}$
    *   These can also be expressed using negative exponents, for example:
        *   $2^{-1}$ represents $\frac{1}{2}$
        *   $5^{-1}$ represents $\frac{1}{5}$
        *   In general, $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$

### III. Dyadic Fraction 

*   **Definition:** A common fraction in which the denominator is a power of two.
*   **Key Characteristic:** The denominator is $2^n$ (where $n$ is a positive integer).
*   **Powers of 2:**
    *   $2^1 = 2$
    *   $2^2 = 4$
    *   $2^3 = 8$
    *   $2^4 = 16$
    *   $2^5 = 32$
    *   $2^6 = 64$
    *   $2^7 = 128$
    *   $2^8 = 256$
    *   $2^9 = 512$
    *   $2^{10} = 1024$
*   **Examples:**
    *   $\frac{1}{8}$ (since $8 = 2^3$)
    *   $\frac{1}{64}$ (since $64 = 2^6$)
    *   $\frac{1}{1024}$ (since $1024 = 2^{10}$)

### IV. Proper & Improper Fraction 

*   **Proper Fraction:**
    *   **Definition:** A fraction where the numerator is less than the denominator.
    *   **Key Characteristic:** Numerator < Denominator
    *   **Examples:**
        *   $\frac{1}{3}$
        *   $\frac{1}{2}$
        *   $\frac{5}{7}$
*   **Improper Fraction:**
    *   **Definition:** A fraction where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.
    *   **Key Characteristic:** Numerator $\geq$ Denominator
    *   **Examples:**
        *   $\frac{4}{3}$
        *   $\frac{6}{4}$

### V. Top-Heavy Fraction 

*   **Definition:** Another name for an improper fraction.
*   **Key Characteristic:** The numerator (top) is bigger than the denominator (bottom).
*   **Examples:**
    *   $\frac{9}{4}$
    *   $\frac{-4}{3}$
    *   $\frac{3}{3}$

### VI. Ratio as Fractions 

*   **Definition:** Ratios can be expressed as fractions. The "is to" symbol (:) represents division.
*   **Examples:**
    *   The ratio of $4:2$ can be written as $\frac{4}{2}$.
    *   The ratio of $4:12$ can be written as $\frac{4}{12}$.
    *   The ratio of $5:3$ can be written as $\frac{5}{3}$.

### VII. Decimal Fractions 

*   **Definition:** Decimal numbers can be converted into fractions.
*   **Conversion Rule:** Count the number of digits after the decimal point. The denominator will be 1 followed by that many zeros.
*   **Examples:**
    *   $0.5 = \frac{5}{10}$ (one digit after decimal, so one zero)
    *   $0.27 = \frac{27}{100}$ (two digits after decimal, so two zeros)
    *   $0.25 = \frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4}$ (can be simplified)
    *   $0.07134 = \frac{7134}{100000}$ (five digits after decimal, so five zeros)

### VIII. Percentages as Fractions 
*   **Definition:** Percentages can be expressed as fractions.
*   **Conversion Rule:** The percent symbol (%) means "out of one hundred," so it's equivalent to dividing by 100.
*   **Examples:**
    *   $5\% = \frac{5}{100}$
    *   $7\% = \frac{7}{100}$
    *   $8\% = \frac{8}{100}$
    *   $10\% = \frac{10}{100}$

### IX. Mixed Fraction 

*   **Definition:** A mixed fraction combines a whole number with a proper fraction. It is typically derived from an improper fraction.
*   **Conversion from Improper Fraction:**
    1.  Divide the numerator by the denominator.
    2.  The quotient becomes the whole number part.
    3.  The remainder becomes the new numerator.
    4.  The original denominator remains the same.
*   **Example:**
    *   Given the improper fraction $\frac{9}{4}$:
        1.  Divide 9 by 4: $9 \div 4 = 2$ with a remainder of $1$.
        2.  The quotient (2) is the whole number.
        3.  The remainder (1) is the new numerator.
        4.  The original denominator (4) stays the same.
    *   *Result:* $2\frac{1}{4}$

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Fractions are fundamental to mathematics and can be represented in various forms.
*   Understanding the different types of fractions is crucial for solving mathematical problems and interpreting data.
*   "Top-heavy fraction" and "dyadic fraction" are specific terms that might appear in competitive exams.
## Topic 33:  Fractions

Fractions represent parts of a whole and are expressed as a quotient, where the numerator is divided by the denominator.

**Types of Fractions:**

1.  **Simple Fraction:** Both the numerator and denominator are integers.
2.  **Complex Fraction:** The numerator or denominator (or both) contains a fraction.
3.  **Proper Fraction:** The numerator is less than the denominator.
4.  **Improper Fraction:** The numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.

## Topic 34:  Advanced Fractions

This section discusses various types of advanced fractions beyond the basic concepts of numerator and denominator.

### 1. Complex Fractions

*   **Definition:** A complex fraction is a fraction where the numerator, the denominator, or both contain other fractions or mixed numbers.
*   **Structure:** It essentially means you have a fraction within a fraction.
*   **Examples from video:**
    *   $\frac{1/2}{1/3}$
    *   $\frac{2\frac{1}{3}}{1\frac{1}{2}}$
    *   $\frac{1/2}{2/3}$
*   **Simplification:** The video mentions that simplification of these fractions will be covered in subsequent examples (implied, not explicitly shown in this segment).

### 2. Compound Fractions

*   **Definition:** A compound fraction is a fraction of a fraction, or any number of fractions connected with the word "of," corresponding to the multiplication of fractions.
*   **Structure:** These fractions involve the multiplication of two or more fractions. The word "of" often implies multiplication in fraction problems.
*   **Example from video:**
    *   $\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{5}{7}$
    *   $\frac{2}{3} \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)$ (which also implies multiplication)
*   **Multiplication Rule:** To multiply compound fractions, multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.

### 3. Special Fractions

*   **Definition:** Fractions that are presented as a single character with a slanted bar (slash), with roughly the same height and width as other characters in the text.
*   **Purpose:** Generally used for simple fractions to save space or for typographical reasons.
*   **Example from video:**
    *   Writing $\frac{1}{2}$ as $1/2$
    *   Writing $\frac{3}{5}$ as $3/5$
*   **Distinction:** The speaker notes that traditionally, fractions are written with a horizontal bar ($\frac{2}{3}$), but using a slanted bar ($2/3$) technically classifies them as "special fractions."

### 4. Shilling or Solidus Fractions (Piece Fractions)

*   **Definition:** This term refers to fractions written with a solidus (slash), similar to special fractions, but often used within exponents or in contexts where readability might be enhanced by a linear format, especially for complex expressions involving powers. They are also known as "piece fractions."
*   **Purpose:** Used for fractions within fractions (complex fractions) or within exponents to increase legibility.
*   **Examples from video (implied):**
    *   $\frac{1}{3^2}$ (written linearly as $1/3^2$)
    *   $\frac{2^{n-1}}{3^{n-1}}$ (written linearly as $2^{n-1}/3^{n-1}$)
*   **Key Idea:** These are fractions where a power or exponent is involved in either the numerator or denominator, and they are typically represented in a single-line format using a slash (solidus) to maintain clarity within a larger mathematical expression.

**Conclusion:**

The speaker emphasizes that understanding these advanced fraction types is important for mathematical knowledge and for competitive exams. They are particularly relevant for higher-level mathematics.

## Topic 35: Properties of Dice

This section outlines the fundamental properties of a die (or cube), which are essential for understanding dice-related problems in reasoning.

*   **Definition:** A die is a small, throwable object with marked sides that can rest in multiple positions. Essentially, a die is a cube. Each of its sides (faces) has a different number placed on it, typically ranging from 1 to 6.

    *   **Minimum Value:** 1
    *   **Maximum Value:** 6

*   **Key Geometric Properties of a Cube/Die:**

    1.  **Faces:** A cube has **six faces**. These are the flat surfaces of the die.
    2.  **Vertices:** A cube has **eight vertices**. These are the corners where multiple edges meet.
    3.  **Edges:** A cube has **twelve edges**. These are the lines where two faces meet.

*   **Relationships Between Faces:**

    1.  **Adjacent Faces:** For any given face on a die, there are **four faces that are adjacent** to it. Adjacent faces share an edge with the chosen face. (Imagine the top face of a box; the four side faces are adjacent to it).
    2.  **Opposite Faces:** A die has **three pairs of opposite faces**. Opposite faces are directly across from each other and do not share any edges. (For example, the top face is opposite the bottom face, the front is opposite the back, and the left is opposite the right).

*   **Visibility:**

    1.  **Visible Sides:** When a die is viewed from a single perspective (at any given time), **only three sides (faces) of the cube are visible**.
    2.  **Non-Opposite Visible Sides:** The three visible sides can **never be on the opposite sides of each other**. This means that if you see a particular face, you cannot simultaneously see the face directly opposite to it.

These properties are crucial for solving various dice-related reasoning questions, especially when dealing with standard dice, open dice, or identifying opposite faces.
## Topic 36: Pattern Completion (Non-Verbal Reasoning)

Pattern completion in non-verbal reasoning involves identifying a missing part of a given figure to complete a logical pattern. This often requires observing symmetries, rotations, reflections, or repeating elements within the figure.

### General Approach:

1.  **Analyze the given pattern (Question Figure):** Carefully observe the overall structure, lines, shapes, shading, and their orientation within the provided figure.
2.  **Divide the figure (if applicable):** For many pattern completion problems involving squares or grids, it's helpful to divide the figure into symmetrical parts (e.g., quarters) to identify the relationship between the known parts and the missing part.
3.  **Identify the relationship:** Determine how the existing parts of the pattern relate to each other. Common relationships include:
    *   **Mirror Image (Reflection):** One part might be a mirror image of another, either horizontally or vertically.
    *   **Rotation:** Parts might be rotated versions of each other (e.g., 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise).
    *   **Repetition:** A smaller pattern might repeat across the figure.
    *   **Symmetry:** The figure might exhibit central, axial, or rotational symmetry.
    *   **Completing a larger shape:** The missing part might complete a larger geometric shape or a specific design element.
    *   **Shading/Filling patterns:** Observe how shaded or filled areas behave.
4.  **Examine the options:** Compare the identified pattern or required missing piece with the given answer choices.
5.  **Select the best fit:** Choose the option that perfectly completes the pattern according to the observed rules.

### Examples from the Video:

**Example 1 (Complex Line Pattern):**

*   **Problem:** Identify the figure that completes the pattern (Figure X).

    ![Pattern Completion Example 1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bX72N8xGgHw/maxresdefault.jpg)

*   **Analysis:** The main figure (X) is a square divided into four smaller quadrants. Three quadrants are filled with lines, and one quadrant is missing (marked with '?'). The lines within the quadrants show a diagonal and cross-hatching pattern.

*   **Solution Strategy (as demonstrated by the instructor):**
    1.  Divide the square into four equal quadrants.
    2.  Observe the relationship between the existing quadrants. The missing part (top-left) should be the **mirror image (reflection)** of the opposite diagonal quadrant (bottom-right).
    3.  Alternatively, the instructor suggests focusing on the orientation of the "pointed" lines in the missing quadrant. Drawing the expected lines to complete the pattern, it becomes clear that the lines should be pointing inwards to the corner.
    4.  Comparing this expected shape with the options, **Option (4)** has the correct orientation and line pattern to complete the square symmetrically.

*   **Result:** Option (4)

**Example 2 (Shaded Quadrants):**

*   **Problem:** Identify the figure that completes the pattern (Figure X).

    ![Pattern Completion Example 2](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bX72N8xGgHw/maxresdefault.jpg)

*   **Analysis:** The figure (X) is a square with an inscribed circle, divided into four quadrants by intersecting lines. One quadrant is missing. There's also a shading pattern: shaded, unshaded, shaded, unshaded. The top-left quadrant is unshaded, the top-right is shaded, the bottom-left is shaded, and the bottom-right is missing.

*   **Solution Strategy (as demonstrated by the instructor):**
    1.  Divide the square into four quadrants.
    2.  Observe the shading pattern and the curved lines:
        *   Top-left: Unshaded.
        *   Top-right: Shaded.
        *   Bottom-left: Shaded.
        *   The shading seems to alternate. If the top-right is shaded, and the bottom-left is shaded, the pattern suggests the opposite quadrant should follow a similar rule or be a continuation of a sequence.
    3.  More importantly, consider the lines within each quadrant. The missing quadrant is the bottom-right. The shape of the lines in the top-left is diagonal, and the bottom-left has a diagonal line in the opposite direction, creating a 'V' shape at the bottom center.
    4.  The instructor points out the shading alternates: Shaded, Unshaded, Shaded, Unshaded. If the top-left is unshaded, top-right is shaded, bottom-left is shaded, then the bottom-right (missing) should be unshaded.
    5.  Looking at the lines, the lines in the missing part should complement the existing lines to form a complete pattern, usually symmetrical or logical. The lines in the missing quadrant should be a reflection or logical continuation of the pattern formed by the other three.
    6.  The instructor highlights that in the missing bottom-right quadrant, only one part should be shaded. Options (1) and (4) show this. However, the orientation of the lines in **Option (4)** correctly completes the overall circular arc and diagonal lines within the square symmetrically.

*   **Result:** Option (4)

**Example 3 (Rotational Squares):**

*   **Problem:** Identify the figure that completes the pattern (Figure X).

    ![Pattern Completion Example 3](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bX72N8xGgHw/maxresdefault.jpg)

*   **Analysis:** The figure (X) is a larger square divided into four quadrants, each containing a smaller square with arrows. The arrows inside the squares are rotating. The top-left quadrant is missing.

*   **Solution Strategy (as demonstrated by the instructor):**
    1.  Divide the figure into four quadrants.
    2.  Focus on the rotational symmetry or transformation. The missing top-left quadrant should be a "mirror image" or a "rotated equivalent" of the bottom-right quadrant.
    3.  The instructor states that the opposite part (bottom-right) should be inverted or turned around.
    4.  Observe the arrows in the bottom-right quadrant. They are pointing outwards from the center. When mirrored/rotated to the top-left, they should still point outwards from the center of the quadrant.
    5.  **Option (2)** correctly shows a square with arrows pointing away from the center of that quadrant, similar to how it would appear if the opposite quadrant was rotated and placed there. The other options do not maintain this central-outward pointing arrow logic when considering the pattern's overall flow.

*   **Result:** Option (2)

### Key Takeaways for Pattern Completion:

*   **Practice is essential:** These problems often rely on quick visual recognition and understanding of geometric transformations (rotation, reflection) and symmetries.
*   **Divide and conquer:** Break down complex patterns into smaller, manageable parts.
*   **Look for relationships:** Always try to find a logical connection or transformation between the existing parts of the pattern.
*   **Consider all elements:** Pay attention to lines, shapes, shading, dots, arrows, and their orientation.
*   **Eliminate incorrect options:** Sometimes it's easier to rule out options that clearly don't fit the pattern than to directly find the correct one.
*   **Non-verbal reasoning** is a common component in competitive exams (SSC, Olympiads, Scholarship exams), and consistent practice helps improve speed and accuracy.

## Topic 37: REGULAR POLYGON

A polygon is called regular if it has equal sides and angles. The sides and angles must be equal.

*   An equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal (60 degrees each). Therefore, it is a regular triangle.
*   A square has all sides equal and all angles equal (90 degrees each). Therefore, it is a regular quadrilateral.

Examples of Regular Polygons:
*   Equilateral Triangle (3 sides)
*   Square (4 sides)
*   Regular Pentagon (5 sides)
*   Regular Hexagon (6 sides)
*   Regular Heptagon (7 sides)
*   Regular Octagon (8 sides)
*   Regular Nonagon (9 sides)

Irregular Polygons are polygons where sides and angles are not all equal.

Formulas for Regular Polygons:

1.  **Interior Angles Formula:**
    The formula to find the measure of one interior angle of a regular polygon is:
    $$ \frac{(n - 2) \times 180^\circ}{n} $$
    Where 'n' is the number of sides (or angles) of the polygon.

    *Example (for a Square, where n=4):*
    $$ \frac{(4 - 2) \times 180^\circ}{4} = \frac{2 \times 180^\circ}{4} = \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ $$
    This confirms that each interior angle of a square is 90 degrees.

2.  **Exterior Angle Formula:**
    The formula to find the measure of one exterior angle of a regular polygon is:
    $$ \frac{360^\circ}{n} $$
    Where 'n' is the number of sides of the polygon.

    *Example (for an Equilateral Triangle, where n=3):*
    $$ \frac{360^\circ}{3} = 120^\circ $$
    This means each exterior angle of an equilateral triangle is 120 degrees.

    *Example (for a Square, where n=4):*
    $$ \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ $$
    This means each exterior angle of a square is 90 degrees.

**Relationship between Interior and Exterior Angles:**
For any polygon, the sum of an interior angle (I) and its adjacent exterior angle (E) is always 180 degrees.
$$ I + E = 180^\circ $$

The video is about advanced polygons. Here's a breakdown of the classification discussed:

## Topic 38: Advanced Polygons: Classification

The video discusses different classifications of polygons beyond the basic definitions. Understanding these classifications helps in studying more complex polygonal shapes.

### 1. Simple Polygons 
*   A simple polygon is one whose sides do not intersect each other.
*   Simple polygons can be further divided into:
    *   **Convex Polygons:** (0:36) All interior angles are less than 180 degrees. If you draw a line segment connecting any two points inside the polygon, the entire segment lies inside the polygon.
    *   **Concave Polygons:** (0:37, 0:50) At least one interior angle is greater than 180 degrees (a reflex angle). A line segment connecting two points inside the polygon might go outside the polygon.

### 2. Equilateral Polygons 
*   **Definition:** A polygon where all sides (edges) are of the same length.
*   **Example:** Figures shown in the video with tick marks on all sides, indicating equal length. An equilateral triangle is a common example.

### 3. Equiangular Polygons 
*   **Definition:** A polygon where all interior angles at the vertices are equal.
*   **Example:** A rectangle. All its angles are 90 degrees, making it equiangular, even if its sides are not all equal.

### 4. Regular Polygons 
*   **Definition:** A polygon that is both **equilateral** (all sides are equal) and **equiangular** (all angles are equal).
*   **Examples:**
    *   Equilateral triangle (regular 3-sided polygon)
    *   Square (regular 4-sided polygon)
    *   Regular pentagon (regular 5-sided polygon)
    *   Regular star (a specific type of regular polygon, as shown in the video)
*   The video illustrates this by showing polygons inscribed within a circle.

### 5. Cyclic Polygons 
*   **Definition:** A polygon whose all vertices lie on a single circle. This circle is called the **circumcircle**.
*   **Example:** A cyclic quadrilateral (a 4-sided polygon whose vertices all lie on a circle).
*   The video mentions that cyclic quadrilaterals are a common topic for problems in advanced geometry.

### 6. Tangential Polygons 
*   **Definition:** A polygon where all sides are tangent to an inscribed circle (a circle drawn inside the polygon that touches each side at a single point).
*   This is the inverse concept of a cyclic polygon.
*   **Example:** A triangle with an inscribed circle.

The speaker emphasizes that while these classifications are introduced, the more detailed properties and problems related to them (especially cyclic quadrilaterals) will be covered in future classes.

## Topic 39:  Equal Fractions

Equal fractions are different representations of the same fractional value. They are obtained by multiplying or dividing both the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same non-zero number.

**Concept:**

If you have a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$, an equal fraction can be found by:
1.  Multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the same non-zero number, $k$:
    $$ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{a \times k}{b \times k} $$
2.  Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same non-zero number, $k$:
    $$ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{a \div k}{b \div k} $$

**Graphical Illustration:**

The video visually demonstrates equal fractions using circles divided into parts:
*   A circle divided into 2 parts with 1 part shaded represents $\frac{1}{2}$.
*   The same circle divided into 4 parts with 2 parts shaded represents $\frac{2}{4}$.
*   The same circle divided into 6 parts with 3 parts shaded represents $\frac{3}{6}$.
*   The same circle divided into 8 parts with 4 parts shaded represents $\frac{4}{8}$.

All these fractions ($\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{4}, \frac{3}{6}, \frac{4}{8}$) represent the same proportion of the circle, hence they are equal fractions.

**Key Takeaway:**

To find an equal fraction, identify the relationship (multiplication or division factor) between the known parts (either numerators or denominators) of the two fractions. Apply the same relationship to the other part (numerator or denominator) to find the missing value. This method ensures that the value of the fraction remains the same.

This video is not a math video. It is a reasoning video. Hence the example provided is not applicable here. 

This video primarily focuses on solving **Word Formation** questions in reasoning. The presenter explains various types of questions related to word formation using letters of a given word.

Here's a breakdown of the content:

## Topic 40:  Word Formation Using Letters of Given Word

This section deals with questions where you need to form meaningful English words either by adding letters to given partial words or by using a subset of letters from a larger word.

*   **Concept:** Given a jumbled set of letters, rearrange them to form a meaningful word (often a common noun, name, or game). Then, answer a question related to the formed word's letters.
*   **Example from Video:**
    *   **Jumbled letters:** `MODBANTIN`
    *   **Question:** "If the name of a game is formed by rearranging the letters of the word MODBANTIN, then what will be the first and the last letter of the name?"
    *   **Solution Process:**
        1.  The instructor quickly identifies the game as **BADMINTON** by recognizing the letters. (This requires familiarity with common words/games).
        2.  Identify the first letter of "BADMINTON": **B**
        3.  Identify the last letter of "BADMINTON": **N**
    *   **Answer:** B, N (Option 3)
*   **Key takeaway:** This type of question tests vocabulary and pattern recognition. The ability to quickly identify the hidden word is crucial.

### Type 2: Alphabetical Ordering of Words

*   **Concept:** Arrange a given list of words in alphabetical order based on their initial letters.
*   **Example from Video:**
    *   **Words:**
        1.  Fame
        2.  Shame
        3.  Name
        4.  Came
    *   **Question:** "Arrange the question based on the initial letter of the word given in the alphabetical order."
    *   **Solution Process:**
        1.  Look at the first letter of each word:
            *   Fame -> F
            *   Shame -> S
            *   Name -> N
            *   Came -> C
        2.  Arrange these initial letters alphabetically: C, F, N, S
        3.  Map back to the original words/numbers:
            *   Came (4)
            *   Fame (1)
            *   Name (3)
            *   Shame (2)
    *   **Answer:** 4, 1, 3, 2
*   **Key takeaway:** This tests basic alphabetical sorting. If initial letters are the same, you'd move to the second letter, and so on (though this example only involved distinct initial letters).

### Type 3: Positional Questions within the English Alphabet

*   **Concept:** These questions involve determining the position of letters or the number of letters between specified positions in the English alphabet, often with variations like "from the left," "from the right," or "backward order."
*   **Important Rules/Definitions:**
    *   **"From the left":** Start counting from 'A' towards 'Z'.
    *   **"From the right":** Start counting from 'Z' towards 'A'.
    *   **"Backward order":** The alphabet is written as Z, Y, X, ..., C, B, A.
*   **Example 1 (Counting Letters Between):**
    *   **Question:** "How many letters are there in between the 8th letter from the left and 7th from right in the English Alphabets?"
    *   **Solution Process:**
        1.  **Write out the alphabet (or mentally visualize):** A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
        2.  **Find the 8th letter from the left:**
            *   A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), F (6), G (7), H (8) -> **H**
        3.  **Find the 7th letter from the right:**
            *   Z (1), Y (2), X (3), W (4), V (5), U (6), T (7) -> **T**
        4.  **Count letters between H and T:**
            *   I (1), J (2), K (3), L (4), M (5), N (6), O (7), P (8), Q (9), R (10), S (11)
    *   **Answer:** 11 (Option D)
    *   **Instructor's Method:** The instructor explicitly writes out the alphabet and then circles the identified letters and counts the ones in between. This visual aid helps avoid confusion.

*   **Example 2 (Positional Logic with Backward Order):**
    *   **Question:** "Which is the 11th letter to the left of the 4th letter from the right when you write the English alphabets in backward order?"
    *   **Solution Process:**
        1.  **Write the alphabet in backward order:** Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A
        2.  **Find the "4th letter from the right" in backward order:** (Remember, "right" in backward order means starting from A).
            *   A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4) -> **D**
        3.  **Now, from "D", find the "11th letter to the left":** (Remember, "left" in backward order means moving towards Z).
            *   D is our starting point. We need to move 11 positions to its left.
            *   Count 11 letters to the left of D:
                *   (From D towards Z): E (1), F (2), G (3), H (4), I (5), J (6), K (7), L (8), M (9), N (10), O (11) -> **O**
    *   **Answer:** O (Option 3)
    *   **Instructor's Method:** The instructor writes the backward alphabet and then explicitly counts from the right to find D, then from D to the left to find O.

*   **Key takeaway:** These questions require careful attention to "left," "right," and whether the alphabet is in standard or backward order. Drawing or writing out the alphabet, especially for backward order, can prevent errors. Practicing these specific types of problems is emphasized.
##  Topic 43: Squares

A square is a **regular quadrilateral**, which means all four sides are of equal length, and all four angles are also equal (each being 90 degrees).

**Properties of a Square:**
* All four sides are equal.
* All four angles are equal (90 degrees).
* The two diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other at a 90-degree angle.

**Formulas for a Square:**

*   **Area of a Square (using Side):**
    *   Formula: $A = s^2$
    *   Where 's' is the length of one side.
    *   Example: If the side (s) is 12 cm, then the Area (A) = $12^2 = 144 cm^2$.

*   **Area of a Square (using Diagonal):**
    *   Formula: $A = \frac{d^2}{2}$
    *   Where 'd' is the length of the diagonal.
    *   Example: If the diagonal (d) is 4 cm, then the Area (A) = $\frac{4^2}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 cm^2$.

*   **Area of a Square (using Perimeter):**
    *   Formula: $A = \frac{P^2}{16}$
    *   Where 'P' is the perimeter of the square.

*   **Perimeter of a Square:**
    *   Formula: $P = 4s$
    *   Where 's' is the length of one side.
    *   Example: If the side (s) is 12 cm, then the Perimeter (P) = $4 \times 12 = 48 cm$.

*   **Diagonal of a Square (using Side):**
    *   Formula: $d = s\sqrt{2}$
    *   Where 's' is the length of one side.
    *   Example: If the side (s) is 5 cm, then the Diagonal (d) = $5\sqrt{2} cm$.

**Key Takeaways:**
*   It's important to memorize these formulas as they are fundamental for solving problems involving squares in various mathematical contexts, including competitive exams and higher-level classes.
*   Always ensure the units are consistent (e.g., cm for length, $cm^2$ for area).
*   Practicing with different types of problems will help in understanding and applying these concepts effectively.
## Topic 44: Rectangles

### Definition and Basic Features

A rectangle is a type of quadrilateral (a polygon with four sides) with the following key characteristics:

*   **Four Sides:** It has four closed sides.
*   **Opposite Sides Equal and Parallel:** The opposite sides are equal in length and parallel to each other.
*   **Four Right Angles:** All four interior angles are equal to 90 degrees. This property also makes it an equiangular quadrilateral.
*   **Equiangular Quadrilateral:** Since all its angles are equal (90 degrees), it is also called an equiangular quadrilateral.

### Other Important Features of Rectangles

*   **Sum of Interior Angles:** The sum of all interior angles in a rectangle is equal to 360 degrees.
*   **Diagonals Bisect Each Other:** The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other (they cut each other into two equal parts at their intersection point).
*   **Diagonals have Same Length:** Both diagonals of a rectangle have the same length.
*   **Diagonal and Circumcircle:** A diagonal of a rectangle is the diameter of its circumcircle (a circle that passes through all four vertices of the rectangle).
*   **Angle of Diagonals' Intersection:** When the diagonals bisect each other, they do so at different angles. One angle is acute (less than 90 degrees), and the other is obtuse (greater than 90 degrees).

### Rectangle Formulas

Let 'l' represent the length and 'b' represent the breadth (or width 'w') of a rectangle.

*   **Area (A):**
    *   Formula: $A = l \times b$ or $A = w \times l$ (as seen in the video using 'w' for width).
    *   Units: The area is expressed in square units (e.g., cm², m²).

*   **Perimeter (P):**
    *   Formula: $P = 2(l + b)$ or $P = 2(l + w)$.
    *   Units: The perimeter is expressed in linear units (e.g., cm, m).

*   **Diagonal (D):**
    *   Formula: $D = \sqrt{l^2 + b^2}$. This comes from the Pythagorean theorem, as the diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with the length and breadth.

*   **Finding Length (l) if Area (A) and Breadth (b) are known:**
    *   Formula: $l = A / b$ or $l = A / w$.

*   **Finding Breadth (b) if Area (A) and Length (l) are known:**
    *   Formula: $b = A / l$ or $w = A / l$.

### Example Rectangle Question

**Problem:** Length and breadth of a rectangle is 17 cm and 15 cm respectively. Calculate its Area and Perimeter.

**Solution:**

1.  **Given:**
    *   Length ($l$) = 17 cm
    *   Breadth ($b$) = 15 cm

2.  **Calculate Area:**
    *   Formula: $Area = l \times b$
    *   Calculation: $Area = 17 \text{ cm} \times 15 \text{ cm} = 255 \text{ cm}^2$

3.  **Calculate Perimeter:**
    *   Formula: $Perimeter = 2(l + b)$
    *   Calculation: $Perimeter = 2(17 \text{ cm} + 15 \text{ cm})$
    *   $Perimeter = 2(32 \text{ cm})$
    *   $Perimeter = 64 \text{ cm}$

**Key Takeaways from the Example:**

*   Units are important. Area is in square units, and perimeter is in linear units.
*   Practice mental math for quicker calculations (e.g., $17 \times 15 = 255$).
*   Understanding the basic formulas is crucial for solving rectangle-related problems, including more complex ones involving percentages or fractions.

## Topic 45: Paper Cutting

*   **Concept:** Paper cutting is a non-verbal reasoning skill that involves visualizing how a folded and cut piece of paper will look when unfolded. It requires strong spatial reasoning.

*   **Method for Learning/Practice:**
    1.  **Hands-on Practice:** The most effective way to learn is by physically performing the actions. For each question:
        *   Take a piece of paper.
        *   Fold it exactly as shown in the initial diagrams (X, Y, Z).
        *   Make the cuts or holes as indicated in the final folded state (Figure Z).
        *   Unfold the paper and observe the resulting pattern.
    2.  **Visualization:** After repeated hands-on practice, you will develop the ability to visualize the unfolding process mentally, allowing you to solve problems without physical paper. This develops an "idea" of where the holes or cuts will appear.

*   **Explanation of Examples (from the video):**

    *   **Example 1 (Square with corner folds and dots):**
        *   **Folding Sequence:**
            1.  A square paper (X) is folded diagonally from the top-left corner downwards.
            2.  Then, the bottom-right corner is folded upwards (Y).
            3.  Finally, the top-right corner is folded inwards. (Z) The resulting shape is a smaller square (or a diamond shape) with a layered corner.
        *   **Cutting/Holes:** Two dots are made in one of the folded layers at the corner (Z).
        *   **Unfolding Result:** When unfolded, these two dots will be replicated in all four corners of the original square, forming a pattern with dots at specific positions in each quadrant.
        *   *Visual Deduction:* The instructor shows that when unfolded, the dots will appear in a pattern matching option (3).

    *   **Example 2 (Square with multiple diagonal folds and triangles):**
        *   **Folding Sequence:**
            1.  A square paper (X) is folded along its main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).
            2.  Then, the two opposite corners (bottom-left and top-right) of the resulting triangle are folded inwards (Y), creating a hexagonal shape.
            3.  This folded paper is then folded again (Z), and cuts are made.
        *   **Cutting/Holes:** Two triangles and two circles are cut into the folded paper (Z).
        *   **Unfolding Result:** When unfolded, the cuts will be reflected across the fold lines. The initial diagonal folds and subsequent folds will cause multiple repetitions of the triangular and circular cuts.
        *   *Visual Deduction:* The instructor sketches the resulting pattern, showing that it corresponds to option (4), with triangles and circles repeated across the unfolded paper.

    *   **Example 3 (Circle with radial folds and triangular cuts):**
        *   **Folding Sequence:**
            1.  A circular paper (X) is folded in half (semi-circle).
            2.  Then, it's folded in half again (quarter-circle) (Y).
            3.  This quarter-circle is folded one more time (Z) into a sector resembling an eighth of a circle.
        *   **Cutting/Holes:** Three small triangular cuts are made along the folded edges of the sector (Z).
        *   **Unfolding Result:** When unfolded, these triangular cuts will be mirrored across each fold, resulting in a pattern of triangles pointing inwards or outwards from the center.
        *   *Visual Deduction:* The instructor indicates that the correct pattern will have all four triangles pointing towards the center of the circle, matching option (4).

    *   **Example 4 (Triangle with multiple folds and dots/triangles):**
        *   **Folding Sequence:**
            1.  A triangular paper (X) is folded along its height.
            2.  Then, the base of the resulting smaller triangle is folded upwards (Y), forming a trapezoidal shape.
            3.  This trapezoid is then folded again (Z).
        *   **Cutting/Holes:** Two small circles and one small triangle are cut into the folded paper (Z).
        *   **Unfolding Result:** When unfolded, the cuts will be reflected. The original triangular shape will have these cuts repeated symmetrically.
        *   *Visual Deduction:* The instructor points to option (1) as the correct answer, indicating that the two circles and triangle will be replicated symmetrically in the unfolded triangular paper.

*   **Key Takeaway:** Paper cutting questions are a test of visualization and spatial reasoning. Consistent practice with physical paper initially, followed by mental visualization, is crucial for mastering this topic for competitive exams like Railway, UPSC, SSC, and Olympiads.

## Topic 46:  Mixed Fractions

A mixed fraction is a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction. It represents a value greater than one.

**Parts of a Mixed Fraction:**

A mixed fraction is typically written in the form $Q \frac{R}{D}$, where:
*   **Q** is the **Whole number** (or **Quotient**).
*   **R** is the **Numerator** (or **Remainder**).
*   **D** is the **Denominator** (or **Divisor**).

**Converting Improper Fractions to Mixed Numbers:**

To convert an improper fraction (where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator) to a mixed number, follow these steps:

1.  **Divide the numerator by the denominator.**
2.  The **quotient** becomes the **whole number** part of the mixed fraction.
3.  The **remainder** becomes the **numerator** of the fractional part.
4.  The **divisor** (original denominator) remains the **denominator** of the fractional part.

*Example:* Convert $\frac{7}{2}$ to a mixed fraction.
1.  Divide $7 \div 2$:
    ```
      3 (Quotient)
    2 | 7
      - 6
      ---
        1 (Remainder)
    ```
2.  The quotient is 3.
3.  The remainder is 1.
4.  The divisor is 2.
5.  Therefore, $\frac{7}{2}$ as a mixed fraction is $3 \frac{1}{2}$.

*Examples from the video:*

1.  **Problem:** $\frac{29}{4}$
    *   **Division:** $29 \div 4 = 7$ with a remainder of $1$.
    *   **Mixed Fraction:** $7 \frac{1}{4}$

2.  **Problem:** $\frac{13}{6}$
    *   **Division:** $13 \div 6 = 2$ with a remainder of $1$.
    *   **Mixed Fraction:** $2 \frac{1}{6}$

**Converting Mixed Numbers to Improper Fractions:**

To convert a mixed number back to an improper fraction, use the following formula:
$$ \frac{(\text{Whole Number} \times \text{Denominator}) + \text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}} $$
Or, using the notation above:
$$ \frac{(Q \times D) + R}{D} $$

*Example:* Convert $7 \frac{1}{3}$ to an improper fraction.
1.  **Multiply:** Whole number ($Q=7$) by Denominator ($D=3$): $7 \times 3 = 21$.
2.  **Add:** Add the Numerator ($R=1$) to the result: $21 + 1 = 22$.
3.  **Keep Denominator:** The denominator remains $3$.
4.  **Improper Fraction:** $\frac{22}{3}$.

*Examples from the video:*

1.  **Problem:** $7 \frac{1}{3}$
    *   **Calculation:** $(7 \times 3) + 1 = 21 + 1 = 22$.
    *   **Improper Fraction:** $\frac{22}{3}$

2.  **Problem:** $7 \frac{3}{4}$
    *   **Calculation:** $(7 \times 4) + 3 = 28 + 3 = 31$.
    *   **Improper Fraction:** $\frac{31}{4}$

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Mixed fractions combine whole numbers and proper fractions.
*   Understanding the relationship between quotient, remainder, and divisor is crucial for converting improper fractions to mixed numbers ($Q \frac{R}{D}$).
*   The formula $(Q \times D + R) / D$ is used to convert mixed numbers back to improper fractions.
*   Practice both conversions to master them.

## Dice and Cube Tricks

The video provides several tricks for solving dice and cube problems, particularly those involving finding opposite faces.

### Trick 1: One Common Face 

*   **Condition**: If two dice are given in different orientations, but *one face* is common between them.
*   **Goal**: Find the face opposite the common face.
*   **Method**:
    1.  Identify the common face.
    2.  List all the numbers visible on both dice, excluding the common face.
    3.  The number from 1 to 6 (for a standard die) that is *not* present in the visible faces will be opposite the common face.
*   **Example :
    *   Dice 1: Faces 5, 3, 6
    *   Dice 2: Faces 5, 4, 1
    *   Common face: 5
    *   Visible faces (excluding 5): 3, 6, 4, 1
    *   Missing number (from 1-6): 2
    *   **Conclusion**: Face 2 is opposite face 5.

*   **Additional Finding :
    *   Once the common face's opposite is found, the remaining faces that are in the "same relative position" in each die (after aligning the common face) will be opposite each other.
    *   **Example (cont.)**:
        *   If 5 is the common face, and it's on top in both images.
        *   Look at Dice 1: 3 (left), 6 (right)
        *   Look at Dice 2: 4 (left), 1 (right)
        *   **Conclusion**: 3 is opposite 4, and 6 is opposite 1.

### Trick 2: Two Common Faces 

*   **Condition**: If two dice are given in different orientations, and *two faces* are common.
*   **Goal**: Find the opposite faces.
*   **Method**:
    1.  Identify the two common faces.
    2.  The remaining two faces (one from each die) that are *not* common will be opposite each other.
*   **Example (02:08)**:
    *   Dice 1: Faces 1, 3, 5
    *   Dice 2: Faces 1, 6, 3
    *   Common faces: 1 and 3
    *   Remaining faces: 5 (from Dice 1) and 6 (from Dice 2)
    *   **Conclusion**: Face 5 is opposite face 6.

### Applying Tricks to Multiple Dice 

*   **Problem Type**: Three positions of a die are given, find the number opposite a specific face.
*   **Method**:
    1.  Identify the target number (e.g., "2").
    2.  Look for any two dice where the target number is visible, AND there's *one common face* (other than the target) or *two common faces* (including the target).
    3.  Apply Trick 1 or Trick 2.
*   **Example :  Find the number opposite 2.
    *   Dice (i): 6, 1, 4
    *   Dice (ii): 5, 3, 6
    *   Dice (iii): 4, 1, 2
    *   Target: 2. Only visible in Dice (iii).
    *   Compare Dice (i) and Dice (iii):
        *   Dice (i): 6, 1, 4
        *   Dice (iii): 4, 1, 2
        *   Common faces: 1 and 4 (two common faces)
        *   Remaining faces: 6 (from Dice i) and 2 (from Dice iii)
        *   **Conclusion**: 2 is opposite 6.

### Applying Tricks to Alphabets 

*   **Problem Type**: Three positions of a die marked with alphabets (A, B, C, D, E, F) are given. Find the alphabet opposite a specific face (e.g., A).
*   **Method**:
    1.  Identify the target alphabet (e.g., "A").
    2.  Look for any two dice where there is *one common alphabet*, but it's *not in the same position* on both dice.
    3.  **Special Rotation Trick : If one common face (e.g., 'C' in this example) is identified between two dice, but its position is *not* the same, then:
        *   Start from the common face and move clockwise on both dice.
        *   The alphabets in corresponding clockwise positions will be opposite each other.
        *   The remaining alphabet not seen will be opposite the common face.
*   **Example: Find the alphabet opposite A.
    *   Dice (i): A, B, C
    *   Dice (ii): D, C, E
    *   Dice (iii): F, E, B
    *   **Comparing Dice (i) and Dice (ii)**:
        *   Common: C
        *   Positions of C are different.
        *   Clockwise from C in Dice (i): C -> B -> A
        *   Clockwise from C in Dice (ii): C -> E -> D
        *   **Opposites**: A is opposite D, B is opposite E.
    *   **Comparing Dice (i) and Dice (iii)**:
        *   Common: B
        *   Positions of B are different.
        *   Clockwise from B in Dice (i): B -> C -> A
        *   Clockwise from B in Dice (iii): B -> F -> E
        *   **Opposites**: A is opposite E, C is opposite F.
    *   The question asks for the opposite of A. From the second comparison (Dice i and Dice iii), we found A is opposite E.
    *   **Conclusion**: The alphabet opposite A is E.

### Topic 47: Open Dice Problems
*   **Concept**: When an open die is folded, opposite faces cannot be adjacent. In a linear arrangement of faces, alternate faces are opposite.
*   **Goal**: Choose the closed box that is similar to the box formed from the given open sheet of paper.
*   **Method**:
    1.  Determine the opposite pairs from the open die.
        *   **Example : Open Die (X)
            *   F is opposite B (alternate in a line)
            *   E is opposite C (alternate in a line)
            *   A is opposite D (the remaining pair)
    2.  Check the given closed dice. For a closed die to be valid, none of its visible faces can be opposite each other.
*   **Example :
    *   Opposite pairs: (F, B), (E, C), (A, D)
    *   **Closed Box (1)**: F, B, E
        *   F and B are opposite. Cannot be seen together. So, Box (1) is incorrect.
    *   **Closed Box (2)**: F, E, D
        *   F is opposite B (not visible).
        *   E is opposite C (not visible).
        *   D is opposite A (not visible).
        *   All visible faces (F, E, D) are not opposite each other. So, Box (2) is correct.
    *   **Closed Box (3)**: E, C, B
        *   E and C are opposite. Cannot be seen together. So, Box (3) is incorrect.
    *   **Conclusion**: Only Box (2) is correct.

### Open Dice (Dots) Problem 

*   **Problem Type**: An open die with dots is shown. Find the number of dots opposite a specific face when the figure is folded to form a cube.
*   **Method**: Apply the same opposite face logic as with alphabets or numbers in an open die. Alternate faces are opposite.
*   **Example :
    *   Open Die: A linear arrangement of 6, 1, 4, 5, 2 (and 3 is linked to 6).
    *   **Opposite pairs**:
        *   6 is opposite 3 (alternate faces).
        *   4 is opposite 5 (alternate faces).
        *   1 is opposite 2 (remaining pair).
    *   **Question**: How many dots lie opposite the face having three dots?
    *   **Conclusion**: 3 dots are opposite 6 dots.

**Key Takeaways**:

*   **Understanding Opposite Faces**: In any closed die, opposite faces are never adjacent.
*   **One Common Face (Clockwise/Anti-clockwise)**: If two dice have one common face, start from that face and move clockwise (or anti-clockwise) in both dice. The faces at corresponding positions will be opposite.
*   **Two Common Faces (Remaining Pair)**: If two dice have two common faces, the remaining two visible faces will be opposite each other.
*   **Open Dice (Alternate Faces)**: In an open dice layout, alternate faces (in a straight line) are opposite each other. The remaining pairs can be found by elimination or specific layout rules.
*   **Validation of Closed Dice from Open Dice**: A closed die formed from an open die is valid only if none of its visible faces are an opposite pair from the open die.

## Topic 48: Coding & Decoding

This section provides an overview of Coding & Decoding questions in competitive exams, particularly focusing on letter and number-based patterns.

*What is Coding & Decoding?*
Coding and decoding involves converting a word, number, or sequence into a secret code (coding) and then deciphering that code back into its original form (decoding). These questions typically provide a relationship or rule for one set of data, and the task is to apply that same rule to another set of data to find the answer.

*Key Information Needed:*
To effectively solve coding and decoding problems, it's crucial to know the forward and backward positional values of each letter in the English alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26, and Z=1, Y=2, ..., A=26). Memorizing these positions will significantly speed up problem-solving.

### Types of Coding & Decoding Questions:

**1. Letter-based Coding:**
In this type, letters are coded using other letters based on a specific pattern.

*   **Example 1: Letter Substitution**
    *   **Problem:** In a certain code, 'MISSIONS' is written as 'MSIISNOS'. How is 'ONLINE' written in that code?
    *   **Given Code:** MISSIONS → MSIISNOS
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   The first and last letters (M and S) of 'MISSIONS' remain the same in the code 'MSIISNOS'.
        *   The middle letters are interchanged in pairs: I-S becomes S-I, S-I becomes I-S, and O-N becomes N-O.
    *   **Applying to 'ONLINE':**
        *   First letter 'O' remains 'O'.
        *   Last letter 'E' remains 'E'.
        *   N-L becomes L-N.
        *   I-N becomes N-I.
    *   **Result:** ONLINE → OLNNIE
    *   **Option:** 1. OLNNIE

*   **Example 2: Letter Shifting (Forward/Backward)**
    *   **Problem:** In a certain code 'FROZEN' is written as 'OFAPSG'. Then how would 'MOLTEN' be written in that code?
    *   **Given Code:** FROZEN → OFAPSG
    *   **Analysis:** (Refer to the alphabet positions: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z)
        *   The code involves shifting letters by a certain number of positions.
        *   F → G (F + 1 position forward)
        *   R → S (R + 1 position forward)
        *   O → P (O + 1 position forward)
        *   Z → A (Z + 1 position forward, cycling back to A)
        *   E → F (E + 1 position forward)
        *   N → O (N + 1 position forward)
        *   The coded word 'OFAPSG' is formed by taking the letter after each original letter, but then *reversing* the order of the letters except the first and last.
        *   Let's check the given code again:
            *   F (+1) → G (this is the LAST letter of the coded word 'OFAPSG')
            *   R (+1) → S (this is the second to last letter of the coded word 'OFAPSG')
            *   O (+1) → P
            *   Z (+1) → A
            *   E (+1) → F
            *   N (+1) → O (this is the FIRST letter of the coded word 'OFAPSG')
        *   So, the pattern is: each letter of FROZEN is replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, and then the *entire new sequence is reversed*.
            *   F (+1) = G
            *   R (+1) = S
            *   O (+1) = P
            *   Z (+1) = A
            *   E (+1) = F
            *   N (+1) = O
            *   New sequence: G S P A F O
            *   Reversed: O F A P S G (Matches the given code)
    *   **Applying to 'MOLTEN':**
        *   M (+1) = N
        *   O (+1) = P
        *   L (+1) = M
        *   T (+1) = U
        *   E (+1) = F
        *   N (+1) = O
        *   New sequence: N P M U F O
        *   Reversed: O F U M P N
    *   **Result:** MOLTEN → OFUMPN
    *   **Option:** 3. OFUMPN

*   **Example 3: Letter Shifting (Consistent Shift)**
    *   **Problem:** In a certain code 'ROAR' is written as 'URDU'. How is 'URDU' written in that code?
    *   **Given Code:** ROAR → URDU
    *   **Analysis:** (Refer to the alphabet positions)
        *   R → U (R + 3 positions forward: S, T, U)
        *   O → R (O + 3 positions forward: P, Q, R)
        *   A → D (A + 3 positions forward: B, C, D)
        *   R → U (R + 3 positions forward: S, T, U)
        *   The rule is to shift each letter forward by 3 positions.
    *   **Applying to 'URDU':**
        *   U (+3) → X (V, W, X)
        *   R (+3) → U (S, T, U)
        *   D (+3) → G (E, F, G)
        *   U (+3) → X (V, W, X)
    *   **Result:** URDU → XUGX
    *   **Option:** 2. XUGX

**2. Number-based Coding:**
In this type, numbers are coded using other numbers based on a specific mathematical pattern.

*   **Example 1: Arithmetic Operations**
    *   **Problem:** In a certain code language 35796 is written as 44887. How is 46823 written in that code? (Bank P. O. Exam. 1991)
    *   **Given Code:** 35796 → 44887
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   3 → 4 (+1)
        *   5 → 4 (-1)
        *   7 → 8 (+1)
        *   9 → 8 (-1)
        *   6 → 7 (+1)
        *   The pattern is alternating +1 and -1 for each digit.
    *   **Applying to 46823:**
        *   4 (+1) → 5
        *   6 (-1) → 5
        *   8 (+1) → 9
        *   2 (-1) → 1
        *   3 (+1) → 4
    *   **Result:** 46823 → 55914
    *   **Option:** b) 55914

*   **Example 2: Simple Subtraction**
    *   **Problem:** A code when applied to the number 786 gives the number 7850. When the number 897 is mapped through the same code, the number that we will get will be?
    *   **Given Code:** 786 → 7850
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   786 - 1 = 785. A '0' is appended at the end.
        *   The rule is to subtract 1 from the number and then append a '0'.
    *   **Applying to 897:**
        *   897 - 1 = 896.
        *   Append '0'.
    *   **Result:** 897 → 8960
    *   **Option:** b) 8960

*   **Example 3: Consistent Subtraction**
    *   **Problem:** In a certain coded language 9999 is mapped as 8888. In the same language what can be the possible code for 11111?
    *   **Given Code:** 9999 → 8888
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   Each digit '9' is replaced by '8', which is '9 - 1'.
        *   The rule is to subtract 1 from each digit.
    *   **Applying to 11111:**
        *   1 (-1) → 0
        *   1 (-1) → 0
        *   1 (-1) → 0
        *   1 (-1) → 0
        *   1 (-1) → 0
    *   **Result:** 11111 → 00000
    *   **Option:** c) 00000

**3. Mixed Coding (Letters mapped to Numbers):**
This type directly maps letters to specific numbers.

*   **Example 1: Direct Mapping**
    *   **Problem:** If P A I N T is coded as 74128 and E X C E L is coded as 93596, then how would you encode A C C E P T?
    *   **Given Codes:**
        *   PAINT → 74128
        *   EXCEL → 93596
    *   **Analysis:** Each letter corresponds to a specific digit.
        *   P = 7
        *   A = 4
        *   I = 1
        *   N = 2
        *   T = 8
        *   E = 9
        *   X = 3
        *   C = 5
        *   L = 6
    *   **Applying to A C C E P T:**
        *   A = 4
        *   C = 5
        *   C = 5
        *   E = 9
        *   P = 7
        *   T = 8
    *   **Result:** ACCEPT → 455978
    *   **Option:** a) 455978

*General Strategy for Coding & Decoding:*

1.  **Identify the relationship:** Look for the pattern or rule that connects the original data to its coded form. This could involve letter shifts, reversals, numerical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), direct mapping, or combinations thereof.
2.  **Analyze the given examples:** If multiple examples are provided, analyze all of them to confirm the consistency of the rule.
3.  **Apply the rule:** Once the rule is clear, apply it to the data in the question to find the encoded or decoded answer.
4.  **Check options:** Compare your derived answer with the given options.

*Key takeaway:* Practice is essential for mastering coding and decoding. The more questions you solve, the better you will become at identifying patterns and applying rules quickly.

## Topic 49 : Frequency

    *   **300:** (1) 300, (2) 300 -> **Frequency = 2**
    *   **200:** (1) 200 -> **Frequency = 1**

2.  **Identify the Highest Frequency:**
    By comparing the frequencies of all unique allowance values, the highest frequency is **7**, corresponding to the allowance of **400**.

**Conclusion:**

The allowance of **400** has the highest frequency (7 occurrences).

## Topic 50: Unscrambling Letters to Form Words

This topic involves arranging a jumbled set of letters to form meaningful words. Once the words are formed, a logical connection or distinction between them needs to be identified to answer the question, often to find the "odd one out."

**Types of Questions:**

1.  **Finding the Odd One Out from Jumbled Words:**
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Given multiple sets of jumbled letters, unscramble each set to form a meaningful word.
        2.  Identify a common theme or category shared by most of the formed words.
        3.  The word that does not fit this theme or category is the "odd one out."
    *   **Example from the video:**
        *   **Problem:** Unscramble the letters in the words given in these questions and find the odd one out.
            *   A) RNAI

        *   **Solution:**
            *   A) 2,3,1,6,4,5 $\rightarrow$ A R V E S T (ARVEST - not a common word)
            *   B) 3,2,4,5,6,1 $\rightarrow$ R A S T E V (RASTEV - not a common word)
            *   C) 4,5,2,3,1,6 $\rightarrow$ S T A R V E (STARVE - a meaningful word)
            *   D) 6,3,4,5,2,1 $\rightarrow$ E R S T A V (ERSTAV - not a common word)
        *   **Answer:** C) 4,5,2,3,1,6 (STARVE)

3.  **Finding the Odd One Out from Numbered Jumbled Letters (similar to Type 1 but with numbered options):**
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Multiple sets of jumbled letters are provided, each with corresponding numbers.
        2.  Unscramble each set of letters to form a meaningful word.
        3.  Identify the common category or theme among most words.
        4.  The word that doesn't fit the theme is the "odd one out."
    *   **Example from the video:**
        *   **Problem:** Unscramble the letters in the given word and find the odd one out.
            *   A) EINNTTR (Note: The instructor corrected the first letter to 'W' during the explanation, implying a potential typo in the original question display, and derived "WINTER" from it)
            *   B) UMRSME
            *   C) PIGRSN
            *   D) LCUOD
        *   **Solution:**
            *   A) W I N T E R (WINTER - a season)
            *   B) S U M M E R (SUMMER - a season)
            *   C) S P R I N G (SPRING - a season)
            *   D) C L O U D (CLOUD - a meteorological phenomenon, not a season)
        *   **Logic:** Winter, Summer, and Spring are all seasons. Cloud is a weather element.
        *   **Answer:** D) LCUOD (CLOUD) is the odd one out.

**Key takeaway for solving these questions:**

*   **Practice is crucial:** Recognizing scrambled words quickly comes with extensive practice and familiarity with common word patterns.
*   **Systematic approach for numbered options:** When given numbered options, try arranging the letters according to each option sequentially until a meaningful word is found.
*   **Logical deduction for "odd one out":** Once words are formed, use general knowledge and logical reasoning to identify the commonality and the exception.

The user wants to extract data in a specific format from the video. However, the video content provided is about "Alphabet Series" and not "Integration Tricks". The example format given is for mathematical integration, which is completely unrelated to the video's content.

Since the video is about "Alphabet Series" and the user provided a specific format for "Integration Trick", I will extract the information about the alphabet series questions and present them in a clear, structured way, similar to how the integration tricks were presented, but adapted for the current video's topic.

Here's the extracted data from the video based on the "Alphabet Series" topic:

## Topic 51: Alphabet Series

This section covers various types of alphabet series questions, including those combined with numbers and fill-in-the-blanks. The presenter emphasizes that practice is key to mastering these types of problems.

### Type 1: Alphabet and Number Series

This type involves a combination of letters and numbers, where both follow a specific pattern.

*How it works:*

1.  **Analyze the Number Pattern:** Identify the numerical sequence and determine the difference or relationship between consecutive numbers.
2.  **Analyze the First Letter Pattern:** Identify the pattern of the first letter in each term. This could be consecutive letters, letters with a fixed gap, or other logical sequences.
3.  **Analyze the Second Letter Pattern:** Identify the pattern of the second letter in each term. This might also be consecutive, reverse, or have a fixed gap.
4.  **Combine to find the missing term:** Use the identified patterns to predict the missing number and letters.

*Example from the video (with solution):*

*   **Problem:** `1. BV 101, ?, DX 109, EY 113, FZ 117`
    `a. CW 105 b. CV 104 c. CW 106`

*   **Step 1: Analyze Number Pattern**
    *   The numbers are: `101, ?, 109, 113, 117`
    *   Difference between 113 and 109 is `4`.
    *   Difference between 117 and 113 is `4`.
    *   This suggests a pattern of adding `+4` to each number.
    *   So, the missing number should be `101 + 4 = 105`.

*   **Step 2: Analyze First Letter Pattern**
    *   The first letters are: `B, ?, D, E, F`
    *   `D` follows `C` (which would be after `B`).
    *   `E` follows `D`.
    *   `F` follows `E`.
    *   This indicates a consecutive letter sequence (B, C, D, E, F).
    *   So, the missing first letter is `C`.

*   **Step 3: Analyze Second Letter Pattern**
    *   The second letters are: `V, ?, X, Y, Z`
    *   `X` follows `W` (which would be after `V`).
    *   `Y` follows `X`.
    *   `Z` follows `Y`.
    *   This indicates a consecutive letter sequence in reverse order (Z, Y, X, W, V).
    *   So, the missing second letter is `W`.

*   **Step 4: Combine**
    *   The missing term is `CW 105`.

*   **Result:** Option `a. CW 105`

### Type 2: Fill-in-the-Blanks Alphabet Series

This type presents a sequence of letters with blanks, and the goal is to fill the blanks to form a repeating pattern.

*How it works:*

1.  **Write out the series:** Write the given series with blanks.
2.  **Test options:** Substitute the letters from each option into the blanks.
3.  **Identify the pattern:** Look for a repeating pattern (e.g., KKL, KKL, KKL) after filling the blanks.

*Example from the video (with solution):*

*   **Problem:** `3. Select the combination of letters that when sequentially placed in the blanks of the given series, will complete the series.`
    `_KL K K _KK _KL`
    `a. KKL LK b. LLKLL c. KLKLL d. LKLKL`

*   **Step 1: Write out the series multiple times (for testing each option)**
    `_KL K _KK _KL`
    `_KL K _KK _KL`
    `_KL K _KK _KL`
    `_KL K _KK _KL`

*   **Step 2: Test Option a. KKL LK**
    *   Fill the blanks: `K K L K K K K L K L`
    *   Break into chunks: `KKL K K K K L K L`
    *   Look for a pattern: `KKL`, `KKK`, `KKL`, `KL` (No clear repeating pattern)

*   **Step 3: Test Option b. LLKLL**
    *   Fill the blanks: `L K L L K K L K K L L`
    *   Break into chunks: `LKL`, `LKL`, `KKL`, `KLL` (No clear repeating pattern)

*   **Step 4: Test Option c. KLKLL**
    *   Fill the blanks: `K K L K L K K L K L L`
    *   Break into chunks: `KKL`, `KLK`, `KKL`, `KLL` (No clear repeating pattern)

*   **Step 5: Test Option d. LKLKL**
    *   Fill the blanks: `L K L K L K K L K L L`
    *   Break into chunks: `LKL`, `KLK`, `KLK`, `LL` (No clear repeating pattern)

    **(Correction/Re-evaluation from video logic):** The presenter re-evaluates the first option.
    Let's re-try option `a. KKL LK` and carefully look for the pattern the presenter found.
    Original Series: `_KL K _KK _KL`
    Blanks (from option a): `K, K, L, L, K`
    Substituting: `K K L K K K K L K L`

    The presenter breaks it down into `KKL K`, `K K K L`, `K L`.
    No, the presenter actually states the pattern is `KK L`, `KK L`, `KK L`, `KK L`.
    Let's apply `a. KKL LK` to the series `_KL K _KK _KL` with the pattern `KKL` (3 letters).
    The series has 11 blanks + letters.
    The pattern is assumed to be `KKL`.
    Let's try to fill the blanks to make `KKL KKL KKL...`
    `KKL KKL KKL KKL`
    If we fill the blanks with `K K L L K`:
    `K K L K K K L K K K L`

    The presenter demonstrates that the pattern is `K K L` repeating.
    The series has 12 spaces in total (9 given letters + 3 blanks, wait, the question shows 6 blanks: `_KL K _KK _KL`).
    Let's count the total positions given: `_ (1) K L (2) K (3) K K (4) _ K L (5)`
    This looks like 12 positions: `_ K L _ K _ K K _ _ K L`
    Let's re-examine the video's example: `—KL K KK —KL`. The video example itself is unclear with blank counts and spacing. It seems like the number of dashes is not consistent with the options.

    Assuming the written series in the video is: `_KL _K _KK _KL` (6 blanks)
    And option `a. KKL LK` has 5 letters. This means the number of blanks and letters in options might not match.

    Let's use the explicit example and solution from the video's explanation of the correct pattern.
    The presenter concludes that `a. KKL LK` results in a repeating pattern `KKL KKL KKL KKL`. This implies the original pattern was `_KL K _KK _KL` and the filled result `K K L K K K K L K L` can be broken down as `KKL KKL KKL KKL`.

    This means the original blank series must be `_KL _K _KK _KL` and the option is `KKL LK`
    `KKLK` `KLKK` `KLKL`
    Let's assume the actual question series has blanks: `--KL --K --KK --KL`
    Total slots: 12. If the pattern is KKL, each block is 3 characters. 12/3 = 4 blocks.
    The pattern is KKL. So the series becomes: `KKLKKLKKLKKL`.
    Given: `--KL --K --KK --KL`
    Comparing with `KKLKKLKKLKKL`:
    1. K K L
    2. K K L
    3. K K L
    4. K K L

    Original series with blanks: `_KL_K_KK__KL`
    Let's try to fill `KKL LK` as the options.
    If the series is `_ K L _ K _ K K _ _ K L` (12 positions, 6 blanks).
    Option `a. K K L L K`
    `K K L K L K K K L L K L`
    This does not create `KKLKKLKKLKKL`.

    **Conclusion based on presenter's stated solution (ignoring mismatch in blanks/option length if it exists):**
    The presenter identifies the pattern `KKL KKL KKL KKL` when option `a. KKL LK` is applied. This suggests the pattern `KKL` repeating.
    *   *Result:* Option `a. KKL LK` makes the series `K K L K K K K L K L` follow the pattern `KKL KKL KKL KKL`. (The explicit filling and resulting pattern stated by the presenter might not perfectly align with the written blanks on screen or the length of option 'a'. However, the core logic is that one of the options creates a repeating block pattern).

### Type 3: Advanced Alphabet Series

This type involves a more complex relationship between letters, often using a fixed increment in alphabetical position.

*How it works:*

1.  **Write out the alphabet:** List A-Z to easily count letter positions.
2.  **Identify the increment for each letter's position:** For each word in the series, compare the position of its first letter to the first letter of the next word, and similarly for the second and third letters.
3.  **Apply the increment:** Use the identified increment to find the next word in the series.

*Example from the video (with solution):*

*   **Problem:** `4. ejo, tyd, ins, xch, ?`
    `a. nrw b. nsw c. mrw`

*   **Step 1: Write out the alphabet**
    `A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z`

*   **Step 2: Analyze the First Letter Pattern (e, t, i, x, ?)**
    *   `e` to `t`: Count from `e` to `t`. `e` (1), f (2), g (3), h (4), i (5), j (6), k (7), l (8), m (9), n (10), o (11), p (12), q (13), r (14), s (15), `t` (16). The increment is `+16`.
    *   `t` to `i`: Count from `t` to `i` (looping around from Z to A). `t` (1), u (2), v (3), w (4), x (5), y (6), z (7), a (8), b (9), c (10), d (11), e (12), f (13), g (14), h (15), `i` (16). The increment is `+16`.
    *   `i` to `x`: Count from `i` to `x`. `i` (1), j (2), k (3), l (4), m (5), n (6), o (7), p (8), q (9), r (10), s (11), t (12), u (13), v (14), w (15), `x` (16). The increment is `+16`.
    *   Following the pattern, the next first letter should be `x + 16`.
    *   `x` (1), y (2), z (3), a (4), b (5), c (6), d (7), e (8), f (9), g (10), h (11), i (12), j (13), k (14), l (15), `m` (16).
    *   So, the next first letter is `M`.
    *   Option `c. mrw` starts with `m`.

*   **Step 3: Analyze the Second Letter Pattern (j, y, n, c, ?)**
    *   `j` to `y`: Count from `j` to `y`. `j` (1), k (2), l (3), m (4), n (5), o (6), p (7), q (8), r (9), s (10), t (11), u (12), v (13), w (14), x (15), `y` (16). The increment is `+16`.
    *   `y` to `n`: Count from `y` to `n`. `y` (1), z (2), a (3), b (4), c (5), d (6), e (7), f (8), g (9), h (10), i (11), j (12), k (13), l (14), m (15), `n` (16). The increment is `+16`.
    *   `n` to `c`: Count from `n` to `c`. `n` (1), o (2), p (3), q (4), r (5), s (6), t (7), u (8), v (9), w (10), x (11), y (12), z (13), a (14), b (15), `c` (16). The increment is `+16`.
    *   Following the pattern, the next second letter should be `c + 16`.
    *   `c` (1), d (2), e (3), f (4), g (5), h (6), i (7), j (8), k (9), l (10), m (11), n (12), o (13), p (14), q (15), `r` (16).
    *   So, the next second letter is `R`.

*   **Step 4: Analyze the Third Letter Pattern (o, d, s, h, ?)**
    *   `o` to `d`: Count from `o` to `d`. `o` (1), p (2), q (3), r (4), s (5), t (6), u (7), v (8), w (9), x (10), y (11), z (12), a (13), b (14), c (15), `d` (16). The increment is `+16`.
    *   `d` to `s`: Count from `d` to `s`. `d` (1), e (2), f (3), g (4), h (5), i (6), j (7), k (8), l (9), m (10), n (11), o (12), p (13), q (14), r (15), `s` (16). The increment is `+16`.
    *   `s` to `h`: Count from `s` to `h`. `s` (1), t (2), u (3), v (4), w (5), x (6), y (7), z (8), a (9), b (10), c (11), d (12), e (13), f (14), g (15), `h` (16). The increment is `+16`.
    *   Following the pattern, the next third letter should be `h + 16`.
    *   `h` (1), i (2), j (3), k (4), l (5), m (6), n (7), o (8), p (9), q (10), r (11), s (12), t (13), u (14), v (15), `w` (16).
    *   So, the next third letter is `W`.

*   **Step 5: Combine**
    *   The missing term is `MRW`.

*   **Result:** Option `c. mrw`

### Type 4: Pattern-based Alphabet Series (Multiple Letter Differences)

This type involves a sequence of letters where the difference between corresponding letters in consecutive terms forms a pattern.

*How it works:*

1.  **Write out the alphabet:** List A-Z to easily count letter positions.
2.  **Compare first letters:** Find the difference in alphabetical position between the first letters of consecutive terms.
3.  **Compare second letters:** Find the difference in alphabetical position between the second letters of consecutive terms.
4.  **Compare third letters (if applicable):** Find the difference for subsequent letters.
5.  **Apply the established difference pattern:** Use these differences to predict the letters of the missing term.

*Example from the video (with solution):*

*   **Problem:** `5. ABEG FFHI KJKK PNNM ?`
    `a. URQO b. VRQO c. RUQO`

*   **Step 1: Write out the alphabet**
    `A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z`

*   **Step 2: Analyze First Letter Pattern (A, F, K, P, ?)**
    *   `A` to `F`: A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4), E (5), `F` (6). Difference: `+6`.
    *   `F` to `K`: F (1), G (2), H (3), I (4), J (5), `K` (6). Difference: `+6`.
    *   `K` to `P`: K (1), L (2), M (3), N (4), O (5), `P` (6). Difference: `+6`.
    *   Following the pattern, the next first letter should be `P + 6`.
    *   `P` (1), Q (2), R (3), S (4), T (5), `U` (6).
    *   So, the next first letter is `U`.
    *   Option `a. URQO` starts with `U`.

*   **Step 3: Analyze Second Letter Pattern (B, F, J, N, ?)**
    *   `B` to `F`: B (1), C (2), D (3), E (4), `F` (5). Difference: `+5`.
    *   `F` to `J`: F (1), G (2), H (3), I (4), `J` (5). Difference: `+5`.
    *   `J` to `N`: J (1), K (2), L (3), M (4), `N` (5). Difference: `+5`.
    *   Following the pattern, the next second letter should be `N + 5`.
    *   `N` (1), O (2), P (3), Q (4), `R` (5).
    *   So, the next second letter is `R`.

*   **Step 4: Analyze Third Letter Pattern (E, H, K, N, ?)**
    *   `E` to `H`: E (1), F (2), G (3), `H` (4). Difference: `+4`.
    *   `H` to `K`: H (1), I (2), J (3), `K` (4). Difference: `+4`.
    *   `K` to `N`: K (1), L (2), M (3), `N` (4). Difference: `+4`.
    *   Following the pattern, the next third letter should be `N + 4`.
    *   `N` (1), O (2), P (3), `Q` (4).
    *   So, the next third letter is `Q`.

*   **Step 5: Analyze Fourth Letter Pattern (G, I, K, M, ?)**
    *   `G` to `I`: G (1), H (2), `I` (3). Difference: `+3`.
    *   `I` to `K`: I (1), J (2), `K` (3). Difference: `+3`.
    *   `K` to `M`: K (1), L (2), `M` (3). Difference: `+3`.
    *   Following the pattern, the next fourth letter should be `M + 3`.
    *   `M` (1), N (2), `O` (3).
    *   So, the next fourth letter is `O`.

*   **Step 6: Combine**
    *   The missing term is `URQO`.

*   **Result:** Option `a. URQO`

*Key Advice:*
*   For any alphabet-related question, it's helpful to write down all letters from A to Z to quickly identify positions and relationships.
*   Practice different varieties of questions to become familiar with various patterns.

## Topic 52: Types of Number Series

This section outlines various types of number series patterns that are commonly encountered in reasoning questions. Understanding these patterns is crucial for solving number series problems efficiently.

### 1. Addition Number Series
In this type of number series reasoning, specific numbers based on some pattern are added to get the next number.
*   **How it works:** Look for a constant difference between consecutive numbers, or a pattern in the differences.
*   **Example from the video:** `3, 5, 7, —`
    *   The difference between 3 and 5 is 2.
    *   The difference between 5 and 7 is 2.
    *   This indicates that a constant number (2) is being added.
    *   The next number would be $7 + 2 = 9$.
*   **Thinking process:** When numbers increase steadily, consider addition as a possible pattern. Check the differences between adjacent numbers.

### 2. Subtraction Number Series
In these types of number series reasoning questions, specific numbers based on some pattern are subtracted to get the next number.
*   **How it works:** Look for a constant difference between consecutive numbers, or a pattern in the differences, where numbers are decreasing.
*   **Example from the video:** `10, 7, 4, —`
    *   The difference between 10 and 7 is -3 (10 - 3 = 7).
    *   The difference between 7 and 4 is -3 (7 - 3 = 4).
    *   This indicates that a constant number (3) is being subtracted.
    *   The next number would be $4 - 3 = 1$.
*   **Thinking process:** When numbers decrease steadily, consider subtraction. Check the differences between adjacent numbers.

### 3. Multiplication Number Series
In this type of number series reasoning, a particular type of number pattern is multiplied to get the next number.
*   **How it works:** Look for a constant multiplier between consecutive numbers, or a pattern in the multipliers.
*   **Example from the video:** `1, 3, 9, —`
    *   1 multiplied by 3 gives 3.
    *   3 multiplied by 3 gives 9.
    *   This indicates a constant multiplier (3).
    *   The next number would be $9 \times 3 = 27$.
*   **Thinking process:** When numbers increase rapidly, consider multiplication. Check the ratios between adjacent numbers.

### 4. Division Number Series
In these types of number series reasoning questions, a particular type of number pattern is divided to get the next number.
*   **How it works:** Look for a constant divisor between consecutive numbers, or a pattern in the divisors. This is the opposite of multiplication series.
*   **Example from the video:** `10, 5, 2.5, —`
    *   10 divided by 2 gives 5.
    *   5 divided by 2 gives 2.5.
    *   This indicates a constant divisor (2).
    *   The next number would be $2.5 / 2 = 1.25$.
*   **Thinking process:** When numbers decrease rapidly, consider division. Check the ratios between adjacent numbers.

### 5. Square Number Series
In square number series reasoning, each number is a perfect square of a particular number pattern.
*   **How it works:** The numbers in the series are squares of consecutive integers, or a patterned sequence of integers.
*   **Example from the video:** `1, 4, 9, 16, —`
    *   1 is $1^2$.
    *   4 is $2^2$.
    *   9 is $3^2$.
    *   16 is $4^2$.
    *   This is a series of perfect squares.
    *   The next number would be $5^2 = 25$.
*   **Key takeaway:** Memorize squares of numbers up to at least 30 (preferably). This helps in quick recognition.

### 6. Cube Number Series
In these types of number series reasoning questions, each number is a perfect cube of a particular number pattern.
*   **How it works:** The numbers in the series are cubes of consecutive integers, or a patterned sequence of integers.
*   **Example from the video:** `1, 8, 27, 64, —`
    *   1 is $1^3$.
    *   8 is $2^3$.
    *   27 is $3^3$.
    *   64 is $4^3$.
    *   This is a series of perfect cubes.
    *   The next number would be $5^3 = 125$.
*   **Key takeaway:** Memorize cubes of numbers up to at least 20. This aids in quick recognition.

### 7. Fibonacci Number Series
In this type of number series reasoning, the next number is the addition of two previous numbers.
*   **How it works:** Each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones. The series typically starts with 0 and 1, or 1 and 1.
*   **Example from the video:** `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, —`
    *   $0 + 1 = 1$
    *   $1 + 1 = 2$
    *   $1 + 2 = 3$
    *   $2 + 3 = 5$
    *   $3 + 5 = 8$
    *   The next number would be $5 + 8 = 13$.
*   **Thinking process:** If numbers don't follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression, check if the sum of previous terms gives the next term.

### 8. Alternating Number Series
In these types of number series reasoning questions, multiple number patterns are used alternatively to form a series.
*   **How it works:** The series consists of two or more independent sub-series interwoven. One sub-series might be increasing, while another might be decreasing or follow a different pattern.
*   **Example from the video:** `8, 10, 9, 11, 10, —`
    *   Sub-series 1 (first, third, fifth terms): `8, 9, 10` (adding 1)
    *   Sub-series 2 (second, fourth terms): `10, 11` (adding 1)
    *   The next number in the first sub-series would be $10 + 1 = 11$.
    *   The next number in the second sub-series would be $11 + 1 = 12$.
    *   Given the pattern in the example `8, 10, 9, 11, 10`, the next number would belong to the second sub-series (11), then the first sub-series (11), etc. Based on the video, the answer for the next term is 12, implying we are looking at the second series to continue. So the series is `8, 10, 9, 11, 10, 12`.
*   **Thinking process:** If the numbers fluctuate between increasing and decreasing, or show an irregular pattern, try analyzing alternate numbers.

### 9. Mixed Operator Number Series
In this type of number series reasoning, multiple operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are applied to get the next number in the series.
*   **How it works:** The pattern involves a combination of operations, often applied sequentially (e.g., multiply then add, subtract then divide). This is generally the most challenging type.
*   **Example from the video:** `1, 2, 6, 21, —`
    *   $1 \times 1 + 1 = 2$
    *   $2 \times 2 + 2 = 6$
    *   $6 \times 3 + 3 = 21$
    *   The pattern is $(\text{current number} \times n) + n$, where $n$ increments from 1.
    *   The next number would be $21 \times 4 + 4 = 84 + 4 = 88$.
*   **Thinking process:** If simple patterns don't work, consider combinations of operations. Look for patterns in the operations themselves (e.g., multiply by 1 then add 1, multiply by 2 then add 2).

### 10. Arranging Number Series
In these types of number series reasoning questions, candidates need to rearrange numbers, as specified, and then answer the given questions.
*   **How it works:** The numbers in the series are given in a jumbled or unsorted order. The task is to arrange them in a specific order (ascending or descending) and then answer questions based on the rearranged sequence.
*   **Example from the video:** `10, 8, 12, 17, 4`
    *   If asked to arrange in ascending order, the sequence would be `4, 8, 10, 12, 17`.
    *   If asked to arrange in descending order, the sequence would be `17, 12, 10, 8, 4`.

## Topic 54: Alphabetical Quibble

Alphabetical Quibble involves reasoning puzzles where letters are assigned numerical values or their positions are manipulated according to specific rules.

*   **Type 1: Numerical Value Assignment**
    *   **Rule:** Each letter in a given sequence is assigned a numerical value based on its position in the arrangement. However, if a letter appears multiple times, it retains the numerical value of its first occurrence, and subsequent unique positions continue the counting sequence.
    *   **Example from the video:**
        *   **Sequence:** M K K I D N E T T Q O B F H A A G T U U X W L S R I
        *   **Value Assignment:**
            *   M = 1
            *   K = 2 (first K)
            *   K = 2 (second K, retains value)
            *   I = 4 (3 is skipped because no letter in that position)
            *   D = 5
            *   N = 6
            *   E = 7
            *   T = 8 (first T)
            *   T = 8 (second T, retains value)
            *   Q = 10 (9 is skipped)
            *   O = 11
            *   B = 12
            *   F = 13
            *   H = 14
            *   A = 15 (first A)
            *   A = 15 (second A, retains value)
            *   G = 17 (16 is skipped)
            *   T = 18
            *   U = 19 (first U)
            *   U = 19 (second U, retains value)
            *   X = 21 (20 is skipped)
            *   W = 22
            *   L = 23
            *   S = 24
            *   R = 25
            *   I = 4 (I already appeared as 4)
        *   **Question:** If the value of A is exactly equal to the total value of which of the following pairs?
            *   Value of A = 15
            *   Pairs to check:
                *   (A) DO: D = 5, O = 11. Sum = 5 + 11 = 16. (Not 15)
                *   (B) QE: Q = 10, E = 7. Sum = 10 + 7 = 17. (Not 15)
                *   (C) MH: M = 1, H = 14. Sum = 1 + 14 = 15. (Matches 15)
            *   **Answer:** (C) MH

*   **Type 2: Vowel/Consonant Replacement with Serial Numbers**
    *   **Rule:**
        *   All vowels in a word are replaced by the number '2'.
        *   Each consonant is replaced by a number which is its serial number (position) in the word, considering only consonants.
    *   **Example from the video:**
        *   **Word:** MAGNIFY
        *   **Vowels:** A, I (replace with 2)
        *   **Consonants:** M, G, N, F, Y (assign serial numbers among consonants)
        *   **Replacement:**
            *   M = 1 (1st consonant)
            *   A = 2 (vowel)
            *   G = 3 (2nd consonant)
            *   N = 4 (3rd consonant)
            *   I = 2 (vowel)
            *   F = 6 (4th consonant, 5 is skipped because I was a vowel)
            *   Y = 7 (5th consonant)
        *   **Question:** What is the total of all the numbers once the replacement is completed?
            *   Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 6, 7
            *   Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 6 + 7 = 25
            *   **Answer:** (C) 25

*   **Type 3: Letter Interchanges**
    *   **Rule:** Letters in the alphabet are interchanged in pairs (A with B, C with D, E with F, and so on).
    *   **Example from the video:**
        *   **Interchanges:**
            *   A ↔ B
            *   C ↔ D
            *   E ↔ F
            *   G ↔ H
            *   I ↔ J
            *   K ↔ L
            *   M ↔ N
            *   O ↔ P
            *   Q ↔ R
            *   S ↔ T
            *   U ↔ V
            *   W ↔ X
            *   Y ↔ Z
        *   **New Alphabetical Order:** B A D C F E H G J I L K N M P O R Q T S V U X W Z Y
        *   **Question:** Which of the following will be seventh from the left?
            *   Counting from the left in the new sequence:
                1.  B
                2.  A
                3.  D
                4.  C
                5.  F
                6.  E
                7.  H
            *   **Answer:** H (Option D, "None of these," since H is not explicitly listed as A, F, or I)

*   **Key Takeaways for Alphabetical Quibble:**
    *   **Careful Reading:** Pay close attention to the specific rules for numerical assignment or letter manipulation.
    *   **Sequential Logic:** Often, the assignments depend on the order or position within the given sequence or the standard alphabet.
    *   **Skipping Values:** Be mindful if certain numerical values are "skipped" due to repeated letters or replacement rules (e.g., vowels replaced by a fixed number).
    *   **Practice:** These puzzles require careful and systematic application of the given rules.

## 1.Division by 11 (without remainder)

This trick provides a shortcut for dividing numbers by 11 when there is no remainder.

**How it works (for 3-digit numbers):**

1.  **Identify the last digit:** The last digit of the dividend (the number being divided) is the first digit of your answer.
    *   Example: For 385 / 11, the last digit is 5. So, the first digit of the answer is 5.

2.  **Subtract the first digit from the remaining number:** Take the remaining digits of the dividend (excluding the last digit) and subtract the first digit of your answer from it. This result is the second digit of your answer.
    *   Example: For 385 / 11, the remaining digits are 38. Subtract 5 from 38 (38 - 5 = 33). Divide this result by 11 (33 / 11 = 3). So, the second digit of the answer is 3.

**How it works (for numbers with more digits):**

1.  **Identify the last digit:** The last digit of the dividend is the first digit of your answer.
    *   Example: For 1331 / 11, the last digit is 1. So, the first digit of the answer is 1.

2.  **Subtract and append:** Take the next digit to the left of the last digit in the dividend. Subtract the last digit of the answer from this digit. This result is the next digit of your answer. If the result is negative, you may need to borrow from the left, or think of it as working backwards.
    *   Example: For 1331 / 11, the next digit to the left of the last digit (1) is 3. Subtract the first digit of the answer (1) from 3 (3 - 1 = 2). This is the second digit of the answer. So the answer starts with 21.

3.  **Repeat the subtraction and append process:** Continue this process for each subsequent digit of the dividend from right to left. Subtract the previously obtained digit of the answer from the current digit of the dividend.
    *   Example: For 1331 / 11, the next digit of the dividend is 3. Subtract the second digit of the answer (2) from 3 (3 - 2 = 1). This is the third digit of the answer. So the answer is 121.

4.  **Final check (for the leftmost digits):** For the remaining leftmost digits of the dividend, after all subtractions, the result of dividing them by 11 should be the remaining digits of your answer.
    *   Example: For 1331 / 11, after getting 121, you're left with the first digit of the dividend (1) and the subtraction result (1). You divide 1 by 11 which will not produce a valid digit. This example suggests a slight variation in the video's explanation for larger numbers or a more complex mental math step for combining digits.

Let's re-examine the video's method for larger numbers for clarity. The speaker states "Last two digits should be separated". It appears the method described for 3-digit numbers is being extended.

**Revised Interpretation of the video's method (for numbers with more than 3 digits):**

1.  **Write down the last digit:** This is the rightmost digit of the quotient.
    *   Example: For 1331 / 11, the last digit is 1. Write down "1".

2.  **Subtract the previously written digit from the next digit to its left:** Move left in the original number. Take the digit you just wrote down and subtract it from the digit to its immediate left in the original number. The result is the next digit of your quotient.
    *   Example: For 1331, the digit to the left of the '1' (from the original number) is '3'. The last digit written in the answer is '1'. So, 3 - 1 = 2. Write down "2" next to the "1", forming "21".
    *   Example: For 1331, the digit to the left of the '3' (from the original number) is '3'. The last digit written in the answer is '2'. So, 3 - 2 = 1. Write down "1" next to the "21", forming "121".
    *   Example: For 1331, the digit to the left of the '3' (from the original number) is '1'. The last digit written in the answer is '1'. So, 1 - 1 = 0. This suggests that the leftmost digit(s) of the quotient are derived by performing division on the *remaining* leading digits after all subtractions have been carried out.
    *   The video's explanation for larger numbers seems to combine subtraction and then division by 11 for the leading part.

**Let's refine the method based on the video's full demonstration:**

**General Method for Division by 11 (without remainder):**

1.  **Write the rightmost digit of the dividend as the rightmost digit of the quotient.**
2.  **Starting from the second digit from the right of the dividend, subtract the digit you just wrote down (from the quotient) from the current digit of the dividend.**
3.  **The result of this subtraction is the next digit to the left in your quotient.**
4.  **Continue this process until you reach the leftmost digit of the dividend.**
5.  **For the final (leftmost) digit of the dividend, the result of the subtraction should be 0 for a perfectly divisible number without remainder.** Or, if you have a multi-digit number remaining on the far left of the dividend after repeated subtractions, that remaining number (divided by 11) forms the leftmost part of the quotient.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: 385 / 11
    *   Write the last digit: 5
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 8. Subtract the written digit (5) from 8: 8 - 5 = 3. Write down 3. (Quotient: 35).
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 3. Subtract the written digit (3) from 3: 3 - 3 = 0. This means the division is complete.
    *   **Result:** 35

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: 473 / 11
    *   Write the last digit: 3
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 7. Subtract the written digit (3) from 7: 7 - 3 = 4. Write down 4. (Quotient: 43).
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 4. Subtract the written digit (4) from 4: 4 - 4 = 0.
    *   **Result:** 43

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: 638 / 11
    *   Write the last digit: 8
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 3. Subtract the written digit (8) from 3: 3 - 8 = -5. This indicates a carry-over or a slightly different approach for intermediate negative results.
    *   The video shows 638 / 11 results in 58. Let's trace the standard mental math way for 638 / 11:
        *   63 divided by 11 is 5 with a remainder of 8.
        *   Bring down the 8 to make 88.
        *   88 divided by 11 is 8.
        *   Result: 58.
    *   The video's method:
        *   Last digit of 638 is 8. Write 8.
        *   Next is 63. 63 - 8 = 55.
        *   55 divided by 11 = 5.
        *   **Result:** 58

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: 748 / 11
    *   Write the last digit: 8
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 4. Subtract the written digit (8) from 4: 4 - 8 = -4. (This highlights the simplification in the video's explanation for this method).
    *   The video's method:
        *   Last digit of 748 is 8. Write 8.
        *   Next is 74. 74 - 8 = 66.
        *   66 divided by 11 = 6.
        *   **Result:** 68

*   **Example 5 (Four-digit number):**
    *   Problem: 1331 / 11
    *   Write the last digit: 1
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 3. Subtract the written digit (1) from 3: 3 - 1 = 2. Write 2. (Current quotient: 21).
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 3. Subtract the written digit (2) from 3: 3 - 2 = 1. Write 1. (Current quotient: 121).
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 1. Subtract the written digit (1) from 1: 1 - 1 = 0.
    *   **Result:** 121

*   **Example 6 (Four-digit number):**
    *   Problem: 9185 / 11
    *   Write the last digit: 5
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 8. Subtract the written digit (5) from 8: 8 - 5 = 3. Write 3. (Current quotient: 35).
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 1. Subtract the written digit (3) from 1: 1 - 3 = -2. (This requires borrowing or a different approach as explained in other mental math tricks. The video implicitly handles this by performing division on the leading group of digits).
    *   The video's method:
        *   Last digit of 9185 is 5. Write 5.
        *   Next is 8. 8 - 5 = 3. Write 3. (Current quotient: 35).
        *   Next is 91. 91 - 3 = 88.
        *   88 divided by 11 = 8. Write 8.
        *   **Result:** 835

*   **Example 7 (Five-digit number):**
    *   Problem: 50853 / 11
    *   Write the last digit: 3
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 5. Subtract the written digit (3) from 5: 5 - 3 = 2. Write 2. (Current quotient: 23).
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 8. Subtract the written digit (2) from 8: 8 - 2 = 6. Write 6. (Current quotient: 623).
    *   Next digit (from dividend) is 0. Subtract the written digit (6) from 0: 0 - 6 = -6.
    *   The video's method:
        *   Last digit of 50853 is 3. Write 3.
        *   Next is 5. 5 - 3 = 2. Write 2. (Current quotient: 23).
        *   Next is 8. 8 - 2 = 6. Write 6. (Current quotient: 623).
        *   Next is 50. 50 - 6 = 44.
        *   44 divided by 11 = 4. Write 4.
        *   **Result:** 4623

**Note:** The video demonstrates a "remainder less" division by 11 trick. It involves working from right to left, subtracting the previously obtained quotient digit from the next digit of the dividend. For longer numbers, the leading digits of the dividend, after successive subtractions, are divided by 11 to get the leading digits of the quotient.
This video describes a simple trick for dividing numbers by 9, specifically focusing on cases where there is no remainder (Model 1). The speaker explains the method through examples.

## 2.Division by 9 Trick (Model 1 - No Remainder)

This trick provides a shortcut for dividing numbers by 9 when the division results in no remainder.

**How it works:**

1.  **Separate the last digit:** Take the number you want to divide by 9 and separate its last digit (the one's place).
    *   Example: For 486, the last digit is 6. The remaining part is 48.

2.  **Add the separated digit to the remaining part:** Add the separated last digit to the number formed by the remaining digits.
    *   Example: For 486, add $48 + 6 = 54$.

* ## 8.Division Trick for Improper Base Below 99

This trick provides a shortcut for finding the quotient and remainder when dividing a four-digit number by 99, especially when the sum of its split parts is less than 99.

**How it works:**

1.  **Split the number:** For a four-digit number $ABCD$, split it into two parts: $AB$ and $CD$.
    *   Example 1: For $3219 \div 99$, split it into $32$ and $19$.
    *   Example 2: For $6512 \div 99$, split it into $65$ and $12$.
    *   Example 3: For $4236 \div 99$, split it into $42$ and $36$.

2.  **Add the split parts:** Add the two split parts together ($AB + CD$).
    *   Example 1: $32 + 19 = 51$.
    *   Example 2: $65 + 12 = 77$.
    *   Example 3: $42 + 36 = 78$.

3.  **Determine if the sum is less than 99:** If the sum of the split parts is less than 99, then this trick applies.

4.  **Identify the quotient:** The first part of the split number ($AB$) is the quotient (Q).
    *   Example 1: For $3219 \div 99$, $Q = 32$.
    *   Example 2: For $6512 \div 99$, $Q = 65$.
    *   Example 3: For $4236 \div 99$, $Q = 42$.

5.  **Identify the remainder:** The sum obtained in step 2 ($AB + CD$) is the remainder (R).
    *   Example 1: For $3219 \div 99$, $R = 51$.
    *   Example 2: For $6512 \div 99$, $R = 77$.
    *   Example 3: For $4236 \div 99$, $R = 78$.

## 9.Division by 99 (Improper Base Above)

This trick provides a shortcut for dividing a four-digit number by 99 when the sum of its split parts is greater than or equal to 99 (improper base above).

**How it works:**

1.  **Split the four-digit number:** Divide the four-digit number into two two-digit parts. The first two digits form the first part, and the last two digits form the second part.
    *   Example 1: For $7887 \div 99$, the parts are $78$ and $87$.
    *   Example 2: For $5468 \div 99$, the parts are $54$ and $68$.
    *   Example 3: For $9816 \div 99$, the parts are $98$ and $16$.

2.  **Add the split parts:** Sum the two two-digit parts.
    *   Example 1: $78 + 87 = 165$.
    *   Example 2: $54 + 68 = 122$.
    *   Example 3: $98 + 16 = 114$.

3.  **Determine the quotient (Q):**
    *   If the sum from step 2 is greater than or equal to 99, take the first two digits of the original number and add the "carry-over" from the sum. The carry-over is the first digit (or digits) of the sum that represents how many times 99 fits into the sum.
    *   Example 1: For $7887 \div 99$, the sum is $165$. $78$ (first part) $+ 1$ (carry-over from $165$) $= 79$. So, $Q=79$.
    *   Example 2: For $5468 \div 99$, the sum is $122$. $54$ (first part) $+ 1$ (carry-over from $122$) $= 55$. So, $Q=55$.
    *   Example 3: For $9816 \div 99$, the sum is $114$. $98$ (first part) $+ 1$ (carry-over from $114$) $= 99$. So, $Q=99$.

4.  **Determine the remainder (R):**
    *   Take the last two digits of the sum from step 2 and add the "carry-over" from the sum.
    *   Example 1: For $7887 \div 99$, the sum is $165$. $65$ (last two digits of $165$) $+ 1$ (carry-over from $165$) $= 66$. So, $R=66$.
    *   Example 2: For $5468 \div 99$, the sum is $122$. $22$ (last two digits of $122$) $+ 1$ (carry-over from $122$) $= 23$. So, $R=23$.
    *   Example 3: For $9816 \div 99$, the sum is $114$. $14$ (last two digits of $114$) $+ 1$ (carry-over from $114$) $= 15$. So, $R=15$.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $7887 \div 99$
    *   Split parts: $78$ and $87$
    *   Sum: $78 + 87 = 165$
    *   Quotient (Q): $78 + 1 = 79$
    *   Remainder (R): $65 + 1 = 66$
    *   **Result:** $Q=79, R=66$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $5468 \div 99$
    *   Split parts: $54$ and $68$
    *   Sum: $54 + 68 = 122$
    *   Quotient (Q): $54 + 1 = 55$
    *   Remainder (R): $22 + 1 = 23$
    *   **Result:** $Q=55, R=23$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $9816 \div 99$
    *   Split parts: $98$ and $16$
    *   Sum: $98 + 16 = 114$
    *   Quotient (Q): $98 + 1 = 99$
    *   Remainder (R): $14 + 1 = 15$
    *   **Result:** $Q=99, R=15$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is specifically for dividing a four-digit number by 99.
*   It is called "improper base above" when the sum of the split parts is 99 or greater.
*   The carry-over from the sum of the split parts is crucial for calculating both the quotient and the remainder.
* ## 10.Division Single Digit Trick

This trick demonstrates a mental math technique for performing division of numbers by a single digit, emphasizing a method of carrying over remainders to simplify the process.

**How it works:**

1.  **Divide the first digit (or first two digits):** Start from the leftmost digit of the dividend. If the first digit is smaller than the divisor, take the first two digits.
2.  **Determine the quotient and remainder:** Divide this initial number by the single-digit divisor.
    *   Write down the quotient as the first digit of your answer.
    *   Note the remainder.
3.  **Carry over the remainder:** Mentally (or physically, by writing a small number) place the remainder next to the next digit of the dividend. This forms a new number.
4.  **Repeat the process:** Divide this new number by the divisor, noting the new quotient and remainder.
    *   Write down the new quotient as the next digit of your answer.
    *   Carry over the new remainder.
5.  **Continue until all digits are used:** Keep repeating steps 3 and 4 until all digits of the dividend have been used.
6.  **Handle decimals (if needed):** If there's a remainder after processing all original digits, add a decimal point to your answer and a zero to the remainder. Continue the division as before.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 269 ÷ 7**

    1.  **2 ÷ 7:** Cannot divide. Take 26.

        *   Remainder: 60 - 56 = 4

    *   **Result:** 38.428

*   **Example 2: 2844 ÷ 5**

    1.  **2 ÷ 5:** Cannot divide. Take 28.

        *   Quotient: 5
        *   Remainder: 28 - 25 = 3

## 11.Two-Digit Division

This technique focuses on performing division with two-digit divisors through a step-by-step mental calculation, emphasizing continuous practice.

**How it works (illustrated with examples):**

The core idea is to break down the division into smaller, manageable steps by looking at how many times the divisor fits into parts of the dividend. Remainders are carried over to the next digit. For decimal results, a decimal point is added, and zeros are appended to the remainder.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 274 divided by 23**
    1.  **Divide 27 by 23:** 23 goes into 27 once (1).
    2.  **Calculate remainder:** $27 - (1 \times 23) = 4$.
    3.  **Bring down next digit:** The remainder 4 is combined with the next digit, 4, to form 44.
    4.  **Divide 44 by 23:** 23 goes into 44 once (1).
    5.  **Calculate remainder:** $44 - (1 \times 23) = 21$.
    6.  **Add decimal and zero:** Since there are no more digits, add a decimal point to the quotient and a zero to the remainder, making it 210.
    7.  **Divide 210 by 23:** 23 goes into 210 nine times (9).
    8.  **Calculate remainder:** $210 - (9 \times 23) = 210 - 207 = 3$.
    9.  **Add zero:** Add another zero to the remainder, making it 30.
    10. **Divide 30 by 23:** 23 goes into 30 once (1).
    *   **Result (approximate):** 11.91

*   **Example 2: 17483 divided by 26**
    1.  **Divide 174 by 26:** 26 goes into 174 six times (6).
    2.  **Calculate remainder:** $174 - (6 \times 26) = 174 - 156 = 18$.
    3.  **Bring down next digit:** The remainder 18 is combined with the next digit, 8, to form 188.
    4.  **Divide 188 by 26:** 26 goes into 188 seven times (7).
    5.  **Calculate remainder:** $188 - (7 \times 26) = 188 - 182 = 6$.
    6.  **Bring down next digit:** The remainder 6 is combined with the next digit, 3, to form 63.
    7.  **Divide 63 by 26:** 26 goes into 63 two times (2).
    8.  **Calculate remainder:** $63 - (2 \times 26) = 63 - 52 = 11$.
    9.  **Add decimal and zero:** Add a decimal point to the quotient and a zero to the remainder, making it 110.
    10. **Divide 110 by 26:** 26 goes into 110 four times (4).
    11. **Calculate remainder:** $110 - (4 \times 26) = 110 - 104 = 6$.
    12. **Add zero:** Add another zero to the remainder, making it 60.
    13. **Divide 60 by 26:** 26 goes into 60 two times (2).
    *   **Result (approximate):** 672.42

*   **Example 3: 185958 divided by 46**
    1.  **Divide 185 by 46:** 46 goes into 185 four times (4).
    2.  **Calculate remainder:** $185 - (4 \times 46) = 185 - 184 = 1$.
    3.  **Bring down next digit:** The remainder 1 is combined with the next digit, 9, to form 19.
    4.  **Recognize inability to divide and add zero:** Since 46 does not go into 19, add a zero to the quotient (0).
    5.  **Bring down next digit:** Bring down the next digit, 5, to form 195.
    6.  **Divide 195 by 46:** 46 goes into 195 four times (4).
    7.  **Calculate remainder:** $195 - (4 \times 46) = 195 - 184 = 11$.
    8.  **Bring down next digit:** The remainder 11 is combined with the next digit, 8, to form 118.
    9.  **Divide 118 by 46:** 46 goes into 118 two times (2).

    * ## 12.Division by 25 Trick

This trick provides a shortcut for dividing a number by 25.

**How it works:**

1.  **Double the number twice:** Take the number you want to divide by 25 and multiply it by 2. Then, take that result and multiply it by 2 again. This is equivalent to multiplying the original number by 4.
    *   Example: To divide 3600 by 25:
        *   First double: $3600 \times 2 = 7200$
        *   Second double: $7200 \times 2 = 14400$
    *   Example: To divide 1200 by 25:
        *   First double: $1200 \times 2 = 2400$
        *   Second double: $2400 \times 2 = 4800$
    *   Example: To divide 700 by 25:
        *   First double: $700 \times 2 = 1400$
        *   Second double: $1400 \times 2 = 2800$

2.  **Place the decimal point:** Take the final doubled number and place a decimal point two places from the right (effectively dividing by 100).
    *   Example: For 14400, placing the decimal gives 144.00.
    *   Example: For 4800, placing the decimal gives 48.00.
    *   Example: For 2800, placing the decimal gives 28.00.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{3600}{25} $$
    *   First double: $3600 \times 2 = 7200$
    *   Second double: $7200 \times 2 = 14400$
    *   **Result:** $144.00 = 144$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{1200}{25} $$
    *   First double: $1200 \times 2 = 2400$
    *   Second double: $2400 \times 2 = 4800$
    *   **Result:** $48.00 = 48$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{700}{25} $$
    *   First double: $700 \times 2 = 1400$
    *   Second double: $1400 \times 2 = 2800$
    *   **Result:** $28.00 = 28$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is essentially multiplying the number by $\frac{4}{100}$, which simplifies the division by 25 to multiplication by 4 and then division by 100.
*   It's a quick mental math technique for division by 25.
*   The final step of placing the decimal point two places from the right is crucial.
* ## 13.Division by 99 Trick

This trick demonstrates a quick method for dividing a specific type of four-digit number by 99.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the number:** This trick applies to four-digit numbers where the sum of the first two digits and the last two digits equals 99.
    *   Example 1: 3663
        *   Split: 36 and 63
        *   Sum: $36 + 63 = 99$
    *   Example 2: 7821
        *   Split: 78 and 21
        *   Sum: $78 + 21 = 99$
    *   Example 3: 5445
        *   Split: 54 and 45
        *   Sum: $54 + 45 = 99$

2.  **Split the number:** Divide the four-digit number into two two-digit numbers. The first two digits form one number, and the last two digits form the second number.

3.  **Add the split numbers:** Sum these two-digit numbers. If the sum is 99, the trick can be applied.

4.  **Determine the quotient:** The quotient of the division will be the first two-digit number plus one.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{3663}{99} $$
    *   Split the number: 36 and 63
    *   Sum of split numbers: $36 + 63 = 99$
    *   First two-digit number: 36
    *   **Result:** $36 + 1 = 37$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{7821}{99} $$
    *   Split the number: 78 and 21
    *   Sum of split numbers: $78 + 21 = 99$
    *   First two-digit number: 78
    *   **Result:** $78 + 1 = 79$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{5445}{99} $$
    *   Split the number: 54 and 45
    *   Sum of split numbers: $54 + 45 = 99$
    *   First two-digit number: 54
    *   **Result:** $54 + 1 = 55$

**Invalid Example from the video:**

*   **Example:** $$ \frac{2849}{99} $$
    *   Split the number: 28 and 49
    *   Sum of split numbers: $28 + 49 = 87$
    *   Since the sum (87) is not equal to 99, this method cannot be used for this particular number. This means that 2849 is not perfectly divisible by 99 using this shortcut.

## 14.Division: Cutting a Number

This method explains how to simplify fractions by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by common factors until they cannot be reduced further.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the numerator and denominator:** Take the given fraction, where one number is the numerator and the other is the denominator.
    *   Example 1: $\frac{264}{72}$
    *   Example 2: $\frac{315}{65}$
    *   Example 3: $\frac{343}{21}$

2.  **Find a common table (factor):** Look for a common number (factor) that divides both the numerator and the denominator.
    *   The video emphasizes knowing divisibility rules (up to 11 and some prime numbers) to easily identify these factors.

3.  **Divide both numbers:** Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the common factor found in step 2.
    *   It is crucial to divide both numbers by the *same* factor.

4.  **Repeat until irreducible:** Continue finding common factors and dividing until there are no more common factors (other than 1) between the new numerator and denominator. The resulting fraction is the simplified form.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: $\frac{264}{72}$**
    1.  Both 264 and 72 are even numbers, so they can be divided by 2.
        *   $264 \div 2 = 132$
        *   $72 \div 2 = 36$
        *   New fraction: $\frac{132}{36}$
    2.  Both 132 and 36 are even numbers, so they can be divided by 2.
        *   $132 \div 2 = 66$
        *   $36 \div 2 = 18$
        *   New fraction: $\frac{66}{18}$
    3.  Both 66 and 18 can be divided by 3 (or 2 again, then 3).
        *   To check for divisibility by 3, sum the digits: $6+6=12$ (divisible by 3), $1+8=9$ (divisible by 3).
        *   $66 \div 3 = 22$ (The video shows $66 \div 2 = 33$ and $18 \div 2 = 9$, then $33 \div 3 = 11$ and $9 \div 3 = 3$. This leads to the same result).
        *   $18 \div 3 = 6$
        *   New fraction: $\frac{22}{6}$
    4.  Both 22 and 6 are even numbers, so they can be divided by 2.
        *   $22 \div 2 = 11$
        *   $6 \div 2 = 3$
        *   New fraction: $\frac{11}{3}$
    5.  11 and 3 do not share any common factors other than 1.
    *   **Result:** $\frac{11}{3}$

*   **Example 2: $\frac{315}{65}$**
    1.  Both 315 and 65 end in 5, so they can be divided by 5.
        *   $315 \div 5 = 63$
        *   $65 \div 5 = 13$
        *   New fraction: $\frac{63}{13}$
    2.  63 and 13 do not share any common factors other than 1.
    *   **Result:** $\frac{63}{13}$

*   **Example 3: $\frac{343}{21}$**
    1.  21 is divisible by 3 and 7. 343 is not divisible by 3 ($3+4+3=10$). Check for divisibility by 7.
        *   $343 \div 7 = 49$
        *   $21 \div 7 = 3$
        *   New fraction: $\frac{49}{3}$
    2.  49 and 3 do not share any common factors other than 1.
    *   **Result:** $\frac{49}{3}$

**Key Points:**

*   This method is useful for simplifying fractions by finding common factors.
*   It is essential to divide both the numerator and the denominator by the *same* number.
*   Knowing divisibility rules helps in quickly identifying common factors.
*   The process is repeated until the fraction is in its simplest form (irreducible).

## 15.Cubes (Yavaduunam Method)

This method, also known as Yavaduunam, is a Vedic Math technique for calculating cubes of numbers, particularly those close to a base value like 10, 100, or 1000. The underlying principle involves using the difference between the number and its nearest base.

**How it works (for numbers near a base of 10):**

1.  **Identify the number and its nearest base:** For a number like 12, the nearest base is 10. The "deficiency" (or surplus) is the difference between the number and the base. For 12, the surplus is +2.
2.  **First part of the answer:** Add the number to twice its surplus.
    *   Example: For 12, it's $12 + (2 \times 2) = 12 + 4 = 16$.
3.  **Second part of the answer:** Multiply the square of the surplus by 3.
    *   Example: For 12, it's $2^2 \times 3 = 4 \times 3 = 12$.
4.  **Third part of the answer:** Cube the surplus.
    *   Example: For 12, it's $2^3 = 8$.
5.  **Combine the parts:** Write down the cubed value (from step 4). Take the unit digit if it's a single digit, and carry over any tens digit. Then, add the carried-over digit to the value from step 3 and write down its unit digit, carrying over any tens digit. Finally, add the carried-over digit to the value from step 2.
    *   Example: For 12:
        *   8 (from $2^3$)
        *   12 (from $2^2 \times 3$), taking 2 and carrying over 1.
        *   16 (from $12 + (2 \times 2)$) + 1 (carry-over) = 17.
        *   Combining these gives 1728.

**How it works (for numbers near a base of 100):**

1.  **Identify the number and its nearest base:** For a number like 99, the nearest base is 100. The "deficiency" (or surplus) is the difference between the number and the base. For 99, the deficiency is -1.
2.  **First part of the answer:** Add the number to twice its deficiency.
    *   Example: For 99, it's $99 + (2 \times -1) = 99 - 2 = 97$.
3.  **Second part of the answer:** Multiply the square of the deficiency by 3. Since the base is 100, this part will have two digits.
    *   Example: For 99, it's $(-1)^2 \times 3 = 1 \times 3 = 3$. As a two-digit number, it's 03.
4.  **Third part of the answer:** Cube the deficiency. Since the base is 100, this part will have two digits.
    *   Example: For 99, it's $(-1)^3 = -1$. As a two-digit representation, it's 01 with a negative sign.
5.  **Combine the parts:** Write down the cubed value (from step 4). If it's negative, borrow from the previous section. Then, combine the next two-digit section. Finally, add any carried-over digits to the first section.
    *   Example: For 99:
        *   -1 (from $(-1)^3$). Since it's negative, we adjust: Borrow 1 from the next section (making 03 into 02), and then $100 - 1 = 99$.
        *   03 (from $(-1)^2 \times 3$). After borrowing, it becomes 02.
        *   97 (from $99 + (2 \times -1)$).
        *   Combining these gives 970299.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: Cube of 12**
    *   Number: 12
    *   Base: 10
    *   Surplus: +2
    *   Step 1 (First part): $12 + (2 \times 2) = 16$
    *   Step 2 (Second part): $2^2 \times 3 = 4 \times 3 = 12$
    *   Step 3 (Third part): $2^3 = 8$
    *   Combine:
        *   8 (unit digit of $2^3$)
        *   2 (unit digit of 12, carry over 1)
        *   16 + 1 (carry over) = 17
    *   **Result: 1728**

*   **Example 2: Cube of 14**
    *   Number: 14
    *   Base: 10
    *   Surplus: +4
    *   Step 1 (First part): $14 + (2 \times 4) = 14 + 8 = 22$
    *   Step 2 (Second part): $4^2 \times 3 = 16 \times 3 = 48$
    *   Step 3 (Third part): $4^3 = 64$
    *   Combine:
        *   4 (unit digit of 64, carry over 6)
        *   48 + 6 (carry over) = 54. 4 (unit digit of 54, carry over 5)
        *   22 + 5 (carry over) = 27
    *   **Result: 2744**

*   **Example 3: Cube of 99**
    *   Number: 99
    *   Base: 100
    *   Deficiency: -1
    *   Step 1 (First part): $99 + (2 \times -1) = 99 - 2 = 97$
    *   Step 2 (Second part): $(-1)^2 \times 3 = 1 \times 3 = 3$ (represented as 03 for base 100)
    *   Step 3 (Third part): $(-1)^3 = -1$ (represented as 01 with a negative sign)
    *   Combine:
        *   Since the last part is -1, borrow 1 from the "03" making it "02", and the -1 becomes $100 - 1 = 99$.
        *   The middle part is now 02.
        *   The first part is 97.
    *   **Result: 970299**

*   **Example 4: Cube of 104**
    *   Number: 104
    *   Base: 100
    *   Surplus: +4
    *   Step 1 (First part): $104 + (2 \times 4) = 104 + 8 = 112$
    *   Step 2 (Second part): $4^2 \times 3 = 16 \times 3 = 48$
    *   Step 3 (Third part): $4^3 = 64$
    *   Combine:
        *   64 (from $4^3$)
        *   48 (from $4^2 \times 3$)
        *   112 (from $104 + (2 \times 4)$)
    *   **Result: 1124864**
    * ## 16.Yavandunam (Square) Trick

This trick provides a shortcut for calculating the square of numbers, especially those near powers of 10 (10, 100, 1000, etc.).

**How it works:**

1.  **Choose a Base:** Identify the nearest power of 10 (10, 100, 1000, etc.) to the number you want to square. This will be your "base."
    *   Example: For $18^2$, the nearest base is 10.
    *   Example: For $1007^2$, the nearest base is 1000.
    *   Example: For $1016^2$, the nearest base is 1000.
    *   Example: For $1032^2$, the nearest base is 1000.

2.  **Find the Difference:** Calculate the difference between the number and your chosen base. Let's call this difference 'd'.
    *   Example: For $18^2$, $d = 18 - 10 = 8$.
    *   Example: For $1007^2$, $d = 1007 - 1000 = 7$.
    *   Example: For $1016^2$, $d = 1016 - 1000 = 16$.
    *   Example: For $1032^2$, $d = 1032 - 1000 = 32$.

3.  **First Part of the Answer:** Add the difference 'd' to the original number. This forms the left part of your answer.
    *   Example: For $18^2$, $18 + 8 = 26$.
    *   Example: For $1007^2$, $1007 + 7 = 1014$.
    *   Example: For $1016^2$, $1016 + 16 = 1032$.
    *   Example: For $1032^2$, $1032 + 32 = 1064$.

4.  **Second Part of the Answer:** Square the difference 'd'. This forms the right part of your answer.
    *   Example: For $18^2$, $8^2 = 64$.
    *   Example: For $1007^2$, $7^2 = 49$.
    *   Example: For $1016^2$, $16^2 = 256$.
    *   Example: For $1032^2$, $32^2 = 1024$.

5.  **Combine and Adjust:**
    *   **Determine the number of digits for the right part:** The number of digits in the squared difference ('d²') should be equal to the number of zeros in your chosen base.
        *   If 'd²' has fewer digits, add leading zeros.
        *   If 'd²' has more digits, carry over the excess digits to the left part of the answer.
    *   **Combine:** Place the adjusted right part next to the left part.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: $18^2$**
    *   Base: 10
    *   Difference (d): $18 - 10 = 8$
    *   First Part: $18 + 8 = 26$
    *   Second Part: $8^2 = 64$
    *   Adjust: Base (10) has one zero, so the second part should have one digit. $64$ has two digits, so carry over the '6'.
        *   Right part becomes '4'.
        *   Carry over '6' to the left part: $26 + 6 = 32$.
    *   **Result:** $324$.

*   **Example 2: $1007^2$**
    *   Base: 1000
    *   Difference (d): $1007 - 1000 = 7$
    *   First Part: $1007 + 7 = 1014$
    *   Second Part: $7^2 = 49$
    *   Adjust: Base (1000) has three zeros, so the second part should have three digits. $49$ has two digits, so add a leading zero: $049$.
    *   **Result:** $1014049$.

*   **Example 3: $1016^2$**
    *   Base: 1000
    *   Difference (d): $1016 - 1000 = 16$
    *   First Part: $1016 + 16 = 1032$
    *   Second Part: $16^2 = 256$
    *   Adjust: Base (1000) has three zeros, and $256$ has three digits. No adjustment needed.
    *   **Result:** $1032256$.

*   **Example 4: $1032^2$**
    *   Base: 1000
    *   Difference (d): $1032 - 1000 = 32$
    *   First Part: $1032 + 32 = 1064$
    *   Second Part: $32^2 = 1024$
    *   Adjust: Base (1000) has three zeros, but $1024$ has four digits. Carry over the '1'.
        *   Right part becomes '024'.
        *   Carry over '1' to the left part: $1064 + 1 = 1065$.
    *   **Result:** $1065024$.

**Key Points:**

*   This Yavandunam method is particularly useful for quickly calculating squares of numbers close to powers of 10.
*   The technique can be applied to numbers both above and below the base.
*   Practice is key to mastering this and other speed math tricks for competitive exams.
* ## 17.Square (Dwantha Yoga Method)
This method, known as Dwantha Yoga in Vedic Mathematics, provides a way to calculate the square of a number, particularly useful for numbers with multiple digits.

**How it works (for a 3-digit number ABC):**

Let the number be represented as ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits. The square of ABC can be found by combining "Dwandwa" or "Dwandwa Yoga" operations on pairs or triplets of digits.

1.  **First digit's Dwandwa (D(A)):** Square the first digit (A²). This forms the leftmost part of the answer.
2.  **First two digits' Dwandwa (D(AB)):** Double the product of the first two digits (2 * A * B).
3.  **All three digits' Dwandwa (D(ABC)):** Double the product of the first and last digits, then add the square of the middle digit (2 * A * C + B²).
4.  **Last two digits' Dwandwa (D(BC)):** Double the product of the last two digits (2 * B * C).
5.  **Last digit's Dwandwa (D(C)):** Square the last digit (C²). This forms the rightmost part of the answer.

**Combining the results:**

The results from each step are then combined, usually by carrying over tens digits from right to left.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 124²**
    *   Here, A=1, B=2, C=4.
    *   1.  D(A) = 1² = 1
    *   2.  D(AB) = 2 * 1 * 2 = 4
    *   3.  D(ABC) = (2 * 1 * 4) + 2² = 8 + 4 = 12
    *   4.  D(BC) = 2 * 2 * 4 = 16
    *   5.  D(C) = 4² = 16
    *   **Combining (from right to left, carrying over):**
        *   _6_ (from 16)
        *   _7_ (1 + 6 = 7)
        *   _3_ (2 + 1 = 3)
        *   _5_ (4 + 1 = 5)
        *   _1_ (from 1)
    *   **Result:** 15376

*   **Example 2: 426²**
    *   Here, A=4, B=2, C=6.
    *   1.  D(A) = 4² = 16
    *   2.  D(AB) = 2 * 4 * 2 = 16
    *   3.  D(ABC) = (2 * 4 * 6) + 2² = 48 + 4 = 52
    *   4.  D(BC) = 2 * 2 * 6 = 24
    *   5.  D(C) = 6² = 36
    *   **Combining (from right to left, carrying over):**
        *   _6_ (from 36)
        *   _7_ (3 + 4 = 7)
        *   _4_ (2 + 2 = 4)
        *   _1_ (5 + 6 = 11, write 1, carry 1)
        *   _8_ (1 + 6 + 1 (carry) = 8)
        *   _1_ (from 1)
    *   **Result:** 181476

The video mentions 316² as a third example, but it is not worked out in the provided segment.

**Key Points:**

*   Dwantha Yoga simplifies squaring large numbers by breaking down the operation into smaller, manageable steps involving multiplication and squaring of single or pairs of digits.
*   The method can be extended to numbers with more than three digits, following a similar pattern of applying Dwandwa operations to increasing and then decreasing groups of digits.
*   Practice is essential to master this technique for quick mental calculations.
* This video teaches how to calculate the square root of a number using the Dwanta Yoga method. This Vedic math technique can be used for both perfect and non-perfect squares, as well as for numbers with decimals. The presenter mentions that he has taught other square root techniques in his "Speed Maths" series, but emphasizes that the Dwanta Yoga method is particularly powerful for larger numbers.

## 18.Dwanta Yoga Method for Square Roots

The Dwanta Yoga method is a Vedic math technique for finding square roots. It can be used for both perfect and non-perfect squares.

**Understanding Dwanta Yoga (Dwandwa Yoga):**

*   **For a single digit number (e.g., 6):** The Dwanta Yoga is simply its square. So, the Dwanta Yoga of 6 is $6^2 = 36$.
*   **For a two-digit number (e.g., 18):** The Dwanta Yoga is calculated by multiplying the digits and doubling the result. For 18, it would be $(1 \times 8) \times 2 = 16$.

**Steps to Calculate Square Root using Dwanta Yoga Method:**

1.  **Pair the digits:** Starting from the right, group the digits of the number into pairs. If the leftmost group has only one digit, it remains as a single digit.
    *   Example: For 53824, divide it into pairs as 5 | 38 | 24.
    *   Example: For 580644, divide it into pairs as 58 | 06 | 44.

2.  **Find the first digit of the square root:**
    *   Take the leftmost group (which might be a single digit or a pair).
    *   Find the largest perfect square less than or equal to this number. The square root of this perfect square is the first digit of your answer.
    *   Write this first digit below the line and its square below the leftmost group.
    *   Subtract the square from the leftmost group to get the remainder.
    *   Double the first digit of your answer and write it as the new divisor.

3.  **Find the subsequent digits of the square root:**
    *   Bring down the next pair of digits to form a new dividend (combine with the previous remainder).
    *   Now, apply the concept of Dwanta Yoga to the digits of your current answer (excluding the last digit you just found).
        *   If it's a single digit, subtract its square from the current dividend.
        *   If it's a two-digit number, find its Dwanta Yoga (multiply the digits and double) and subtract it from the current dividend.
    *   Divide the result by the current divisor (from step 2, doubled). The quotient is the next digit of your square root.
    *   Write this digit next to the previous digit of your answer.
    *   Write the remainder next to the remaining digits of the original number.

4.  **Repeat until all digits are used:** Continue this process, bringing down pairs of digits, calculating Dwanta Yoga of the previous answer digits, subtracting, dividing by the doubled initial digit, and finding remainders, until all the digits of the original number have been used.

5.  **Final Check (last digit):** The last digit of your square root is confirmed if, when you calculate the Dwanta Yoga of the last digit (its square if it's a single digit, or by multiplying the last two digits and doubling if it's a two-digit number) and subtract it from the last remainder, you get zero.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

**Example 1: Square root of 53824**

1.  **Pair the digits:** 5 | 38 | 24

2.  **First digit:**
    *   Leftmost group is 5.
    *   The largest perfect square less than or equal to 5 is 4 ($2^2$).
    *   First digit of answer: 2.
    *   Remainder: $5 - 4 = 1$.
    *   New divisor: $2 \times 2 = 4$.

3.  **Second digit:**
    *   New dividend: 1 (remainder) combined with 38 = 138.
    *   Dwanta Yoga of the first answer digit (2) is $2^2 = 4$.
    *   Subtract: $13 - 4 = 9$.
    *   Divide by divisor (4): $9 \div 4 = 2$ with a remainder of 1.
    *   Second digit of answer: 3.
    *   Remainder is 1 (after $13 \div 4 = 3$, $3 \times 4 = 12$, $13 - 12 = 1$). (The video uses 13 for division, not 138).
    *   New dividend: 1 (remainder) combined with 8 = 18.
    *   Dwanta Yoga of the last found digit (3) is $3^2 = 9$.
    *   Subtract: $18 - 9 = 9$.
    *   Divide by divisor (4): $9 \div 4 = 2$ with a remainder of 1.
    *   Third digit of answer: 2.

4.  **Third digit:** (The video's explanation for the third digit is a bit confusing and seems to combine steps. Let's re-evaluate based on standard Dwanta Yoga method).

    *   New dividend: The remainder from the previous step (1) combined with the next digit (2) forming 12.
    *   Dwanta Yoga of the current last two digits of the answer (2 and 3) is $(2 \times 3) \times 2 = 12$.
    *   Subtract: $12 - 12 = 0$.
    *   New dividend: 0 (remainder) combined with 4 = 04.
    *   Dwanta Yoga of the last found digit (2) is $2^2 = 4$.
    *   Subtract: $4 - 4 = 0$.

    *   **Result:** 232.

**Example 2: Square root of 580644**

1.  **Pair the digits:** 58 | 06 | 44

2.  **First digit:**
    *   Leftmost group is 58.
    *   Largest perfect square less than or equal to 58 is 49 ($7^2$).
    *   First digit of answer: 7.
    *   Remainder: $58 - 49 = 9$.
    *   New divisor: $7 \times 2 = 14$.

3.  **Second digit:**
    *   New dividend: 9 (remainder) combined with 06 = 906. (The video uses 90 for division).
    *   Dwanta Yoga of the first answer digit (7) is $7^2 = 49$. (This is not applied here, indicating a slight variation from what was previously stated in the video for a single digit).
    *   Divide 90 by divisor (14): $90 \div 14 = 6$ with a remainder of 6. ($6 \times 14 = 84$, $90 - 84 = 6$).
    *   Second digit of answer: 6.
    *   Remainder is 6.

4.  **Third digit:**
    *   New dividend: 6 (remainder) combined with 6 = 66.
    *   Dwanta Yoga of the last found digit (6) is $6^2 = 36$. (This is incorrect based on the video's earlier explanation of two-digit Dwanta Yoga).
    *   The video applies the Dwanta Yoga of the current single digit from the answer (6) which is $6^2 = 36$. (This seems to be a specific step in the process, not general Dwanta Yoga).
    *   Subtract: $66 - 36 = 30$.
    *   Divide 30 by divisor (14): $30 \div 14 = 2$ with a remainder of 2. ($2 \times 14 = 28$, $30 - 28 = 2$).
    *   Third digit of answer: 2.

5.  **Final Check:**
    *   New dividend: 2 (remainder) combined with 4 = 24.
    *   Dwanta Yoga of the last two digits of the answer (6 and 2) is $(6 \times 2) \times 2 = 24$.
    *   Subtract: $24 - 24 = 0$.

    *   **Result:** 762.

**Key Points from the video:**

*   The video highlights that this method, once mastered, allows for easy calculation of square roots for very large numbers, including those with decimals.
*   The presenter encourages practice with various examples.
*   The video shows how to find square roots for both 5-digit and 6-digit numbers.
# * 19.vestanam
* The video explains how to use the "Vestanam" (osculation) method in Vedic Mathematics to check the divisibility of numbers by 7. This method is particularly useful for larger numbers where traditional division can be time-consuming.

**Key Concept: Vestanam (Osculation)**
Vestanam is a Vedic Maths Sutra that helps identify divisibility for numbers like 7, 13, 19, 23, and 29. The core idea is to find a specific "osculator" for the divisor (in this case, 7) and then apply a simple multiplication and addition/subtraction process.

**Finding the Osculator for 7:**
The video demonstrates that by multiplying 7 by 7, you get 49. To find the osculator, you take the first digit (4) and add 1 to it, resulting in 5. Therefore, the osculator for 7 is 5. This means for checking divisibility by 7, you multiply the last digit of the number by 5 and add it to the remaining part of the number.

**How the Vestanam Method Works for Divisibility by 7:**

1.  **Identify the last digit** of the number.
2.  **Multiply the last digit by the osculator (5)**.
3.  **Add this product to the remaining digits** of the original number (the number with the last digit removed).
4.  **Repeat the process** until you get a small number that you can easily determine if it's divisible by 7.

**Examples from the video:**

*   **21:**
    1.  Last digit is 1.
    2.  $1 \times 5 = 5$.
    3.  Remaining digits are 2.
    4.  $5 + 2 = 7$.
    5.  Since 7 is divisible by 7, 21 is divisible by 7.

*   **91:**
    1.  Last digit is 1.
    2.  $1 \times 5 = 5$.
    3.  Remaining digits are 9.
    4.  $5 + 9 = 14$.
    5.  Since 14 is divisible by 7, 91 is divisible by 7.

*   **14:**
    1.  Last digit is 4.
    2.  $4 \times 5 = 20$.
    3.  Remaining digits are 1.
    4.  $20 + 1 = 21$.
    5.  Since 21 is divisible by 7, 14 is divisible by 7.

*   **112:**
    1.  Last digit is 2.
    2.  $2 \times 5 = 10$.
    3.  Remaining digits are 11.
    4.  $10 + 11 = 21$.
    5.  Since 21 is divisible by 7, 112 is divisible by 7.

*   **2107:**
    1.  Last digit is 7.
    2.  $7 \times 5 = 35$.
    3.  Remaining digits are 210.
    4.  $35 + 210 = 245$.
    5.  Now, take 245:
        1.  Last digit is 5.
        2.  $5 \times 5 = 25$.
        3.  Remaining digits are 24.
        4.  $25 + 24 = 49$.
        5.  Since 49 is divisible by 7, 2107 is divisible by 7.

**Alternative Divisibility Rules for 7:**
While the video focuses on the Vestanam method (multiplying the last digit by 5 and adding), there are other common divisibility rules for 7:

*   **Doubling and Subtracting:** Double the last digit and subtract it from the remaining part of the number. If the result is 0 or a multiple of 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. For example, to check 357: double 7 to get 14, then subtract 14 from 35 to get 21. Since 21 is divisible by 7, 357 is divisible by 7.
*   **Pattern of Multiplication:** Multiply each digit from the right (ones place) by 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, and repeat this sequence. Add the products, and if the sum is divisible by 7, the original number is too. For example, to check 2016: $6(1) + 1(3) + 0(2) + 2(6) = 21$. Since 21 is divisible by 7, 2016 is also divisible by 7.
* ## 20.Divisibility Trick (Vestanam)

This trick, called "Vestanam" in Vedic Mathematics, provides a method to check the divisibility of a large number by another number by repeatedly reducing the numbers.

**How it works:**

1.  **Find the "Vestanam" of the divisor:**
    *   Take the divisor (the number you want to check divisibility by).
    *   Multiply the divisor by a single-digit number such that the unit digit of the product is 9.
    *   Take the digit(s) preceding the unit digit (9) in the product.
    *   Add 1 to this preceding digit(s). This result is the "Vestanam" (or "Vaeshtanam") of the divisor.

    *   **Example 1: Divisor = 17**
        *   Multiply 17 by a number to get a unit digit of 9: $17 \times 7 = 119$.
        *   The digit(s) preceding 9 is 11.
        *   Add 1 to 11: $11 + 1 = 12$.
        *   So, the Vestanam of 17 is 12.

    *   **Example 2: Divisor = 19**
        *   Multiply 19 by a number to get a unit digit of 9: $19 \times 1 = 19$.
        *   The digit(s) preceding 9 is 1.
        *   Add 1 to 1: $1 + 1 = 2$.
        *   So, the Vestanam of 19 is 2.

    *   **Example 3: Divisor = 29**
        *   Multiply 29 by a number to get a unit digit of 9: $29 \times 1 = 29$.
        *   The digit(s) preceding 9 is 2.
        *   Add 1 to 2: $2 + 1 = 3$.
        *   So, the Vestanam of 29 is 3.

    *   **Example 4: Divisor = 23**
        *   Multiply 23 by a number to get a unit digit of 9: $23 \times 3 = 69$.
        *   The digit(s) preceding 9 is 6.
        *   Add 1 to 6: $6 + 1 = 7$.
        *   So, the Vestanam of 23 is 7.
        *   *Note: If the unit digit is not 9, such as with 14, you might need to adjust. For example, half of 14 is 7, and you could work with that. The goal is to make the unit digit an odd number to eventually get a unit digit of 9 in the multiplication.*

2.  **Apply the Vestanam to the number being tested for divisibility:**
    *   Take the original large number.
    *   Multiply its last digit by the Vestanam.
    *   Add this product to the remaining part of the number (excluding the last digit).
    *   Repeat this process: take the last digit of the new number, multiply it by the Vestanam, and add it to the remaining part.
    *   Continue this process until you get a smaller number that you can easily check for divisibility by the original divisor.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Problem 1:** Is 2755 divisible by 19?
    *   Vestanam of 19 is 2.
    *   Steps:
        1.  Take 275**5**. Multiply the last digit (5) by the Vestanam (2): $5 \times 2 = 10$.
        2.  Add 10 to the remaining part (275): $275 + 10 = 285$.
        3.  Take 28**5**. Multiply the last digit (5) by the Vestanam (2): $5 \times 2 = 10$.
        4.  Add 10 to the remaining part (28): $28 + 10 = 38$.
        5.  Take 3**8**. Multiply the last digit (8) by the Vestanam (2): $8 \times 2 = 16$.
        6.  Add 16 to the remaining part (3): $3 + 16 = 19$.
    *   Since 19 is divisible by 19, 2755 is divisible by 19.

*   **Problem 2:** Is 243629 divisible by 29?
    *   Vestanam of 29 is 3.
    *   Steps:
        1.  Take 24362**9**. Multiply the last digit (9) by the Vestanam (3): $9 \times 3 = 27$.
        2.  Add 27 to the remaining part (24362): $24362 + 27 = 24389$.
        3.  Take 2438**9**. Multiply the last digit (9) by the Vestanam (3): $9 \times 3 = 27$.
        4.  Add 27 to the remaining part (2438): $2438 + 27 = 2465$.
        5.  Take 246**5**. Multiply the last digit (5) by the Vestanam (3): $5 \times 3 = 15$.
        6.  Add 15 to the remaining part (246): $246 + 15 = 261$.
        7.  Take 26**1**. Multiply the last digit (1) by the Vestanam (3): $1 \times 3 = 3$.
        8.  Add 3 to the remaining part (26): $26 + 3 = 29$.
    *   Since 29 is divisible by 29, 243629 is divisible by 29.

*   **Problem 3:** Is 32821 divisible by 23?
    *   Vestanam of 23 is 7.
    *   Steps:
        1.  Take 3282**1**. Multiply the last digit (1) by the Vestanam (7): $1 \times 7 = 7$.
        2.  Add 7 to the remaining part (3282): $3282 + 7 = 3289$.
        3.  Take 328**9**. Multiply the last digit (9) by the Vestanam (7): $9 \times 7 = 63$.
        4.  Add 63 to the remaining part (328): $328 + 63 = 391$.
        5.  Take 39**1**. Multiply the last digit (1) by the Vestanam (7): $1 \times 7 = 7$.
        6.  Add 7 to the remaining part (39): $39 + 7 = 46$.
    *   Since 46 is divisible by 23 ($23 \times 2 = 46$), 32821 is divisible by 23.

**Key Points:**

*   This method is particularly useful for checking the divisibility of large numbers by prime numbers or numbers that do not have simple divisibility rules.
*   The key is to correctly identify the "Vestanam" of the divisor.
*   The process can be repeated until the number becomes small enough to determine divisibility by inspection.
* ## 21.Division by 7 Trick (Kevaliah Saptakam Gunayat)

This trick provides a shortcut for finding the decimal representation of fractions with a denominator of 7. The method relies on a repeating sequence of digits.

**How it works:**

1.  **Memorize the base number:** Remember the number 143. This number is key to generating the repeating decimal sequence.
2.  **Multiply the numerator:** Multiply the numerator of the fraction by 143.
    *   Example for $\frac{2}{7}$: $2 \times 143 = 286$.
    *   Example for $\frac{3}{7}$: $3 \times 143 = 429$.
    *   Example for $\frac{4}{7}$: $4 \times 143 = 572$.
3.  **Adjust the product:** Subtract 1 from the result obtained in the previous step.
    *   Example for $\frac{2}{7}$: $286 - 1 = 285$.
    *   Example for $\frac{3}{7}$: $429 - 1 = 428$.
    *   Example for $\frac{4}{7}$: $572 - 1 = 571$.
4.  **Form the initial decimal sequence:** Place "0." followed by the adjusted product. These will be the first three digits of the repeating decimal.
    *   Example for $\frac{2}{7}$: $0.285$.
    *   Example for $\frac{3}{7}$: $0.428$.
    *   Example for $\frac{4}{7}$: $0.571$.
5.  **Derive the remaining digits by subtracting from 9:** For each digit in the initial three-digit sequence, subtract it from 9 to find the corresponding next digit in the repeating pattern.
    *   Example for $\frac{2}{7}$ (starting with 285):
        *   $9 - 2 = 7$
        *   $9 - 8 = 1$
        *   $9 - 5 = 4$
        *   So, the next digits are 714.
        *   The full repeating sequence is 285714.
    *   Example for $\frac{3}{7}$ (starting with 428):
        *   $9 - 4 = 5$
        *   $9 - 2 = 7$
        *   $9 - 8 = 1$
        *   So, the next digits are 571.
        *   The full repeating sequence is 428571.
    *   Example for $\frac{4}{7}$ (starting with 571):
        *   $9 - 5 = 4$
        *   $9 - 7 = 2$
        *   $9 - 1 = 8$
        *   So, the next digits are 428.
        *   The full repeating sequence is 571428.

**General Method:**

For any fraction $\frac{N}{7}$:

1.  Calculate $M = N \times 143$.
2.  The first three digits of the repeating decimal are the digits of $M-1$. Let these be $d_1 d_2 d_3$.
3.  The next three digits are $ (9-d_1)(9-d_2)(9-d_3) $.
4.  The decimal representation is $0.\overline{d_1 d_2 d_3 (9-d_1)(9-d_2)(9-d_3)}$.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $\frac{2}{7}$
    *   Multiply numerator by 143: $2 \times 143 = 286$.
    *   Subtract 1: $286 - 1 = 285$.
    *   Form initial decimal: $0.285$.
    *   Subtract from 9: $9-2=7$, $9-8=1$, $9-5=4$.
    *   **Result:** $0.285714...$ (repeating)

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $\frac{3}{7}$
    *   Multiply numerator by 143: $3 \times 143 = 429$.
    *   Subtract 1: $429 - 1 = 428$.
    *   Form initial decimal: $0.428$.
    *   Subtract from 9: $9-4=5$, $9-2=7$, $9-8=1$.
    *   **Result:** $0.428571...$ (repeating)

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $\frac{4}{7}$
    *   Multiply numerator by 143: $4 \times 143 = 572$.
    *   Subtract 1: $572 - 1 = 571$.
    *   Form initial decimal: $0.571$.
    *   Subtract from 9: $9-5=4$, $9-7=2$, $9-1=8$.
    *   **Result:** $0.571428...$ (repeating)

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is specifically designed for fractions with a denominator of 7.
*   It simplifies the process of finding the repeating decimal pattern without long division.
*   The number 143 is derived from $\frac{1000}{7} \approx 142.857$, so multiplying by 143 and then adjusting by subtracting 1 approximates the first three digits of the repeating decimal cycle.
*   The repeating block of digits for any fraction $\frac{N}{7}$ will always be a cyclic permutation of the digits $1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7$.
* ## 22.Baudhayana Shulbasutra (Pythagoras Theorem)

This video explains the Baudhayana Shulbasutra, which details the concept of the Pythagoras theorem.

**How it works:**

1.  **Understanding the components:** The theorem applies to a right-angled triangle, which has three sides:
    *   **Base (b):** One of the two shorter sides of the right-angled triangle.
    *   **Altitude (a):** The other shorter side of the right-angled triangle, perpendicular to the base.
    *   **Hypotenuse (c):** The longest side of the right-angled triangle, opposite the right angle.

2.  **Visualizing with squares:** Imagine squares are constructed on each side of the right-angled triangle.
    *   Square A: Built on the altitude 'a'.
    *   Square B: Built on the base 'b'.
    *   Square C: Built on the hypotenuse 'c'.

3.  **The fundamental principle:** The core idea is that the sum of the areas of the squares built on the two shorter sides (base and altitude) is equal to the area of the square built on the longest side (hypotenuse).

    *   This means: Area of Square A + Area of Square B = Area of Square C.

4.  **Mathematical representation:** If the side lengths of the squares are 'a', 'b', and 'c' respectively, then their areas are $a^2$, $b^2$, and $c^2$.
    *   Therefore, the theorem can be expressed as: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

**Example from the video:**

*   **Consider a right-angled triangle with sides:**
    *   Altitude (a) = 3 units
    *   Base (b) = 4 units
    *   Hypotenuse (c) = 5 units

*   **Applying the theorem:**
    *   Area of Square A = $3^2 = 9$
    *   Area of Square B = $4^2 = 16$
    *   Area of Square C = $5^2 = 25$

*   **Verification:** $9 + 16 = 25$. This demonstrates that the sum of the areas of the squares on the two shorter sides (9 and 16) equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (25).

**Key Points:**

*   The Baudhayana Shulbasutra is an ancient Indian text that describes this geometric principle, predating Pythagoras.
*   The Pythagoras theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry, particularly for right-angled triangles.
*   It is widely used in various fields including trigonometry, engineering, and architecture.
* ## 23.Baudhayana Shulbasutra (Non-Perfect Squares)

This trick provides a shortcut for finding the approximate square root of non-perfect squares using the Baudhayana Shulbasutra method.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the nearest perfect square:** For the given non-perfect square, find the nearest perfect square. Let its square root be 'N'.
    *   Example 1: For $\sqrt{47}$, the nearest perfect square is $36$ (which is $6^2$) or $49$ (which is $7^2$). In the video, the tutor chooses $36$, so $N=6$.
    *   Example 2: For $\sqrt{31}$, the nearest perfect square is $25$ (which is $5^2$). So $N=5$.
    *   Example 3: For $\sqrt{19}$, the nearest perfect square is $16$ (which is $4^2$). So $N=4$.

2.  **Divide the number by 'N':** Divide the non-perfect square by the identified square root 'N'. Calculate the result to one decimal place.
    *   Example 1: $47 \div 6 = 7.8$ (approximately)
    *   Example 2: $31 \div 5 = 6.2$ (approximately)
    *   Example 3: $19 \div 4 = 4.7$ (approximately)

3.  **Add 'N' to the result:** Add 'N' to the result obtained in step 2.
    *   Example 1: $7.8 + 6 = 13.8$
    *   Example 2: $6.2 + 5 = 11.2$
    *   Example 3: $4.7 + 4 = 8.7$

4.  **Divide the sum by 2:** Divide the sum obtained in step 3 by 2. This will be the approximate square root of the non-perfect square.
    *   Example 1: $13.8 \div 2 = 6.9$
    *   Example 2: $11.2 \div 2 = 5.6$
    *   Example 3: $8.7 \div 2 = 4.35$

**General Method:**

To find the approximate value of $\sqrt{X}$ (where X is a non-perfect square):

1.  Find the nearest perfect square $N^2$ to $X$.
2.  Calculate $Y = X / N$. (Approximate to one decimal place).
3.  Calculate $Z = Y + N$.
4.  The approximate square root is $Z / 2$.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: $\sqrt{47}$**
    1.  Nearest perfect square: $36 = 6^2$. So, $N = 6$.
    2.  Divide: $47 \div 6 = 7.8$.
    3.  Add N: $7.8 + 6 = 13.8$.
    4.  Divide by 2: $13.8 \div 2 = 6.9$.
    *   **Approximate $\sqrt{47} \approx 6.9$.**

*   **Example 2: $\sqrt{31}$**
    1.  Nearest perfect square: $25 = 5^2$. So, $N = 5$.
    2.  Divide: $31 \div 5 = 6.2$.
    3.  Add N: $6.2 + 5 = 11.2$.
    4.  Divide by 2: $11.2 \div 2 = 5.6$.
    *   **Approximate $\sqrt{31} \approx 5.6$.**

*   **Example 3: $\sqrt{19}$**
    1.  Nearest perfect square: $16 = 4^2$. So, $N = 4$.
    2.  Divide: $19 \div 4 = 4.7$.
    3.  Add N: $4.7 + 4 = 8.7$.
    4.  Divide by 2: $8.7 \div 2 = 4.35$.
    *   **Approximate $\sqrt{19} \approx 4.35$.**

**Key Points:**

*   This method provides an approximate value for the square root of non-perfect squares.
*   The accuracy of the approximation depends on how many decimal places are calculated in step 2.
*   This trick is useful in competitive exams or situations where quick estimations of square roots are needed, especially for numbers encountered in physics or mathematics problems.
* ## 24.Cube (Adyam Sutra)

This method, derived from Vedic Mathematics and the algebraic identity $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$, provides a shortcut for calculating the cube of a two-digit number.

**How it works:**

1.  **Divide the number:** For a two-digit number, treat the tens digit as 'a' and the units digit as 'b'.
    *   Example 1: For $32^3$, $a=3$ and $b=2$.
    *   Example 2: For $41^3$, $a=4$ and $b=1$.
    *   Example 3: For $54^3$, $a=5$ and $b=4$.

2.  **Calculate the four parts:** Compute the values for $a^3$, $3a^2b$, $3ab^2$, and $b^3$.
    *   **$a^3$**: Cube of the tens digit.
    *   **$3a^2b$**: Three times the square of the tens digit multiplied by the units digit.
    *   **$3ab^2$**: Three times the tens digit multiplied by the square of the units digit.
    *   **$b^3$**: Cube of the units digit.

3.  **Arrange the results:** Write down these four calculated values separated by slashes.

4.  **Combine the digits (from right to left):**
    *   **Units digit:** The units digit of $b^3$ is the units digit of the final answer. Any tens digit from $b^3$ is carried over.
    *   **Tens digit:** The units digit of $3ab^2$ (plus any carry-over from the previous step) is the next digit of the final answer. Any tens digit from this sum is carried over.
    *   **Hundreds digit:** The units digit of $3a^2b$ (plus any carry-over from the previous step) is the next digit of the final answer. Any tens digit from this sum is carried over.
    *   **Remaining digits:** The remaining value of $a^3$ (plus any carry-over from the previous step) forms the leading digits of the final answer.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: $32^3$**
    *   1.  Identify a and b: $a=3$, $b=2$.
    *   2.  Calculate the four parts:
        *   $a^3 = 3^3 = 27$
        *   $3a^2b = 3 \times 3^2 \times 2 = 3 \times 9 \times 2 = 54$
        *   $3ab^2 = 3 \times 3 \times 2^2 = 3 \times 3 \times 4 = 36$
        *   $b^3 = 2^3 = 8$
    *   3.  Arrange: $27 / 54 / 36 / 8$
    *   4.  Combine:
        *   8 (units digit of $b^3$)
        *   6 (units digit of $3ab^2$, no carry-over)
        *   $4+3=7$ (units digit of $3a^2b$ + tens digit from $3ab^2$)
        *   $27+5=32$ (remaining $a^3$ + tens digit from $3a^2b$)
    *   **Result:** $32768$

*   **Example 2: $41^3$**
    *   1.  Identify a and b: $a=4$, $b=1$.
    *   2.  Calculate the four parts:
        *   $a^3 = 4^3 = 64$
        *   $3a^2b = 3 \times 4^2 \times 1 = 3 \times 16 \times 1 = 48$
        *   $3ab^2 = 3 \times 4 \times 1^2 = 3 \times 4 \times 1 = 12$
        *   $b^3 = 1^3 = 1$
    *   3.  Arrange: $64 / 48 / 12 / 1$
    *   4.  Combine:
        *   1 (units digit of $b^3$)
        *   2 (units digit of $3ab^2$, no carry-over)
        *   $8+1=9$ (units digit of $3a^2b$ + tens digit from $3ab^2$)
        *   $64+4=68$ (remaining $a^3$ + tens digit from $3a^2b$)
    *   **Result:** $68921$

*   **Example 3: $54^3$**
    *   1.  Identify a and b: $a=5$, $b=4$.
    *   2.  Calculate the four parts:
        *   $a^3 = 5^3 = 125$
        *   $3a^2b = 3 \times 5^2 \times 4 = 3 \times 25 \times 4 = 300$
        *   $3ab^2 = 3 \times 5 \times 4^2 = 3 \times 5 \times 16 = 240$
        *   $b^3 = 4^3 = 64$
    *   3.  Arrange: $125 / 300 / 240 / 64$
    *   4.  Combine:
        *   4 (units digit of $b^3$)
        *   $0+6=6$ (units digit of $3ab^2$ + tens digit from $b^3$)
        *   $0+24=24$. Write down 4 (units digit of $3a^2b$ + tens digit from $3ab^2$ + carry-over). Carry over 2.
        *   $5+30=35$. Write down 7 (units digit of $a^3$ + tens digit from $a^3$ + carry-over). Carry over 3.
        *   $12+3=15$ (remaining from $a^3$ + carry-over).
    *   **Result:** $157464$

**Key Points:**

*   This method is useful for quickly calculating the cube of two-digit numbers.
*   It breaks down the problem into smaller, manageable calculations based on the algebraic expansion of $(a+b)^3$.
*   Careful attention should be paid to carrying over tens digits when combining the results from right to left.
# * 25.Powers
* The user wants me to extract information about "Powers" from the provided video, following the same schema as the examples given.

Here's a breakdown of the video content regarding "Powers":

The video defines powers, also known as exponents or indices, as a way to indicate how many times a number is multiplied by itself. It then explains three key rules:

1.  **Power of 1:** If the power of a number is 1, the result is the number itself.
    *   Example: $8^1 = 8$
    *   Example from video: $5^1 = 5$

2.  **Power of 0:** If the power of any digit is 0, the result is always 1.
    *   Example: $5^0 = 1$
    *   Example from video: $a^0 = 1$, $1000^0 = 1$

3.  **Negative Power:** If the power is a negative value, the result is the reciprocal of the number with a positive power.
    *   Example: $5^{-1} = 1/5$
    *   Example from video: $5^{-2} = 1/5^2$, $5^{-3} = 1/5^3$

Let's extract this information following the provided schema.

```
Powers

This section defines powers (also known as exponents or indices) and explains three key rules related to them.

**Definition:**

The power of a number indicates how many times the number is used in a multiplication.

**Key Rules and How They Work:**

1.  **If the power is 1:**
    *   **Rule:** If the power of a number is 1, then you just have the number itself.
    *   **Example from video:**
        *   Problem: $5^1$
        *   **Result:** $5$

2.  **If the power is 0:**
    *   **Rule:** If the power is 0, then the result is always 1. This applies to any digit.
    *   **Example from video:**
        *   Problem: $5^0$
        *   **Result:** $1$
        *   Problem: $a^0$
        *   **Result:** $1$
        *   Problem: $1000^0$
        *   **Result:** $1$

3.  **If the power is a negative value:**
    *   **Rule:** If the power is a negative value, then you just have the reciprocals. To remove the negative sign from the exponent, take the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent.
    *   **Example from video:**
        *   Problem: $5^{-2}$
        *   **Result:** $\frac{1}{5^2}$
        *   Problem: $5^{-3}$
        *   **Result:** $\frac{1}{5^3}$

**General Understanding from Video:**

*   A number raised to a power means multiplying that number by itself the number of times indicated by the power.
    *   For example: $5^2 = 5 \times 5$
    *   For example: $5^7 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5$
*   A number with a power of 2 is also called a "square".
*   A number with a power of 3 is also called a "cube".
*   The term "reciprocal" refers to flipping a fraction. In this context, if the power is negative, taking the reciprocal means writing 1 over the base with the now positive power. The top part of a fraction is called the numerator, and the bottom part is called the denominator.
```
## 26.Cube Numbers

This video explains what cube numbers are and how to calculate them.

**Definition:**

A cube number is a number that has been multiplied by itself, and then multiplied by itself again. In other words, it is the product of three equal numbers.

The Malayalam term for cube numbers is "ഘന സംഖ്യകൾ" (ghana sankhyakal).

**How to calculate cube numbers:**

To find the cube of a number, you multiply the number by itself three times. This can be represented using exponents, where the number is raised to the power of 3 (e.g., $7^3$).

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **1 cubed ($1^3$):**
    *   $1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1$

*   **2 cubed ($2^3$):**
    *   $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$

*   **3 cubed ($3^3$):**
    *   $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$

*   **7 cubed ($7^3$):**
    *   $7 \times 7 \times 7 = 343$

**List of Cubes from 1 to 10 (as shown in the video):**

The video also displays a table of cube numbers from 1 to 10.

*   $1 = 1$
*   $2 = 8$
*   $3 = 27$
*   $4 = 64$
*   $5 = 125$
*   $6 = 216$
*   $7 = 343$
*   $8 = 512$
*   $9 = 729$
*   $10 = 1000$

**Comparison with Square Numbers:**

The video briefly contrasts cube numbers with square numbers. A square number is obtained by multiplying a number by itself twice (e.g., $6^2 = 6 \times 6 = 36$). The exponent indicates how many times the number is multiplied by itself.

**Key takeaway:**

Memorizing the cube roots of numbers from 1 to 10 can be helpful for solving problems in exams.
## 27.Place value and Face Value

This video discusses the concepts of place value and face value of digits in numbers, using the Indian and International numbering systems. It also provides examples and practice questions on finding the difference between place values and face values, and forming numbers from given digits.

**1. Reading Numbers:**

The video explains how to read numbers in both the Indian and International numbering systems.

*   **Indian System Example:**
    *   The number 5,64,73,829 is read as "Five crore, sixty-four lakh, seventy-three thousand, eight hundred and twenty-nine."

*   **International System Example:**
    *   The same number, 5,64,73,829, is read as "Fifty-six million, four hundred seventy-three thousand, eight hundred and twenty-nine."

**2. Place Value:**

The place value of a digit is its value based on its position in the number. As a digit moves to a different position, its value changes.

*   **Example 1: In the number 5,64,73,829**
    *   Place value of 9 is 9 (ones place).
    *   Place value of 2 is 20 (tens place).
    *   Place value of 8 is 800 (hundreds place).
    *   Place value of 3 is 3,000 (thousands place).
    *   Place value of 7 is 70,000 (ten thousands place).
    *   Place value of 4 is 4,00,000 (lakhs place).

*   **Example 2: In the number 34682**
    *   Place value of 6 is 600 (hundreds place).

*   **Example 3: In the number 673125**
    *   Place value of 7 is 70,000 (ten thousands place).

*   **Example 4: In the number 973216**
    *   Place value of 3 is 3,000 (thousands place).

*   **Example 5: In the number 7638120**
    *   Place value of 7 is 70,00,000 (ten lakhs place).

*   **Example 6: In the number 2418095**
    *   Place value of 8 is 8,000 (thousands place).

**3. Face Value:**

The face value of a digit is the digit itself, regardless of its position in the number. The face value never changes.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Face value of 9 is 9.
    *   Face value of 2 is 2.
    *   Face value of 3 is 3.
    *   Face value of 6 is 6.

*   **Example 2: In the number 2418095**
    *   Face value of 8 is 8.
    *   Face value of 9 is 9.

**4. Practice Questions:**

*   **Find the difference of the place values of two 5's in 345673457.**
    *   One 5 is in the tens place, so its place value is 50.
    *   Another 5 is in the ten lakhs place, so its place value is 50,00,000.
    *   Difference = 50,00,000 - 50 = 49,99,950.

*   **Find the difference of the face values of two 3's in 435673120.**
    *   The face value of any 3 is 3.
    *   Difference = 3 - 3 = 0.

*   **Find the difference between the place value and face value of 3 in 3120.**
    *   Place value of 3 is 3000 (thousands place).
    *   Face value of 3 is 3.
    *   Difference = 3000 - 3 = 2997.

*   **Write the smallest and the greatest 4-digit number that can be formed by the digits 3, 5, 4, 1.**
    *   **Greatest number:** Arrange the digits in descending order: 5431.
    *   **Smallest number:** Arrange the digits in ascending order: 1345.

*   **Write the difference between the place value of the underlined digits in the following:**
    *   **7,47,46,286 (underlined digits are the first 7 and 86)**
        *   Place value of the first 7 is 7,00,000 (lakhs place).
        *   Place value of 86 is 86 (tens and ones place).
        *   Difference = 7,00,000 - 86 = 6,99,914.
    *   **8,34,83,123 (underlined digits are the first 8 and 83)**
        *   Place value of the first 8 is 8,00,00,000 (crores place).
        *   Place value of 83 is 83 (tens and ones place).
        *   Difference = 8,00,00,000 - 83.

    * ## 28.Division by 5 (Mental Math Trick)

This video demonstrates a simple mental math trick for quickly dividing any number by 5.

**How it works:**

To divide a number by 5, you simply perform two steps:

1.  **Double the number:** Multiply the given number by 2.
2.  **Place the decimal point:** Place a decimal point one digit from the right in the doubled number.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: Divide 316 by 5**
    *   Double 316: $316 \times 2 = 632$
    *   Place decimal point one digit from the right: $63.2$
    *   **Result:** 63.2

*   **Example 2: Divide 26 by 5**
    *   Double 26: $26 \times 2 = 52$
    *   Place decimal point one digit from the right: $5.2$
    *   **Result:** 5.2

*   **Example 3: Divide 4672 by 5**
    *   Double 4672: $4672 \times 2 = 9344$
    *   Place decimal point one digit from the right: $934.4$
    *   **Result:** 934.4

**Key Points:**

*   This trick simplifies division by 5 into a multiplication and a decimal placement.
*   It is particularly useful for mental calculations.
* The user is requesting an extraction of information from the video in the same format as the provided examples. However, the video is not about integration tricks but rather discusses various methods for finding factors of numbers. Therefore, the requested information cannot be extracted directly in the provided schema. I will instead summarize the key concepts explained in the video about factors.

## 29.Factors of numbers 

The video provides a comprehensive explanation of factors, covering definitions, methods of factorization, and various related concepts such as the number of factors, sum of factors, sum of reciprocals of factors, and sum of the product of factors.

### 1. What are Factors of a Number?

A factor of a number is an integer that divides the number evenly, leaving no remainder.

**Example:** For the number 12, the factors are:
*   3 is a factor of 12 because 12 ÷ 3 = 4 (exactly). 
*   6 is a factor of 12 because 12 ÷ 6 = 2 (exactly). 
*   Other factors of 12 include 1, 2, 4, and 12. 

For any given number, 1 and the number itself are always factors. 

### 2. Prime Factorization

Prime factorization is the process of breaking down a number into its prime factors. This involves dividing the number repeatedly by prime numbers until all factors are prime. 

**Example:** Prime factorization of 12:
1.  Divide 12 by the smallest prime number, 2: 12 ÷ 2 = 6. 
2.  Divide 6 by 2: 6 ÷ 2 = 3.
3.  Divide 3 by 3: 3 ÷ 3 = 1. 
So, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 × 2 × 3, which can be written as 2^2 × 3^1. 

### 3. Factors of Exponents

When a number is expressed in its prime factorized form, like 12 = 2^2 × 3^1, the bases (2 and 3) are the repeated factors, and the exponents (2 and 1) indicate how many times each factor appears. This exponential form is crucial for calculating the number and sum of factors.

### 4. Number of Factors

To find the number of factors of a number:
1.  Perform the prime factorization of the number and express it in exponential form (e.g., N = p1^a × p2^b × p3^c...). 
2.  Add 1 to each exponent (a+1, b+1, c+1...). 
3.  Multiply these new numbers together: (a+1) × (b+1) × (c+1). The result is the total number of factors. 

**Example:** For 12 = 2^2 × 3^1:
1.  Exponents are 2 and 1.
2.  Add 1 to each: (2+1) = 3 and (1+1) = 2. 
3.  Multiply: 3 × 2 = 6. So, 12 has 6 factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). 

### 5. Sum of Factors

To find the sum of factors of a number N = p1^a × p2^b × p3^c...:
Use the formula: [(p1^(a+1) - 1) / (p1 - 1)] × [(p2^(b+1) - 1) / (p2 - 1)] × ...

**Example:** For 36 = 2^2 × 3^2:
1.  Apply the formula: [(2^(2+1) - 1) / (2 - 1)] × [(3^(2+1) - 1) / (3 - 1)] [cite: 9:15, 9:36]
2.  Calculate: [(2^3 - 1) / 1] × [(3^3 - 1) / 2] = [ (8 - 1) / 1 ] × [ (27 - 1) / 2 ] [cite: 9:49, 9:55]
3.  Simplify: 7 × (26 / 2) = 7 × 13 = 91. 
The sum of factors of 36 is 91. 

### 6. Sum of Reciprocals of Factors

To find the sum of the reciprocals of factors of a number:
Sum of Reciprocals = (Sum of Factors) / (The Number Itself) 

**Example:** For 6, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 6.
1.  Sum of factors (1+2+3+6) = 12.
2.  Sum of reciprocals = 12 / 6 = 2. 

### 7. Sum of the Product of Factors

To find the sum of the product of factors of a number (N):
Sum of the product of factors = N^((number of factors)/2) 

**Example:** For 36:
1.  Number of factors of 36 is 9 (calculated by 2^2 × 3^2 -> (2+1) × (2+1) = 3 × 3 = 9). 
2.  Sum of the product of factors = 36^(9/2) = 36^(4.5).
The video explicitly states the result for 216 as 216^8. 

The presenter emphasizes the importance of consistent practice for mastering these factorization techniques. 
    * The user is requesting an extraction of information from the video in the same format as the provided examples. However, the video is not about integration tricks but rather demonstrates a "continuous half of a number" exercise. Therefore, the requested information cannot be extracted directly in the provided schema. I will instead summarize the key concepts explained in the video about practicing continuous halves of numbers.

## 30.Practice Continuous Half of a Number

The video demonstrates a mathematical exercise focused on continuously halving a given number. This mental math practice aims to improve speed and accuracy in calculations.

**How it Works:**

The core concept is to repeatedly divide a number by 2, finding its half, then the half of that result, and so on.

**Examples Demonstrated in the Video:**

The presenter walks through several examples, starting with an initial number and verbally stating its continuous halves.

1.  **Starting Number: 14** 
    *   Half of 14 is 7.
    *   Half of 7 is 3.5. 
    *   Half of 3.5 is 1.75. 
    *   Half of 1.75 is 0.875. 
    *   Half of 0.875 is 0.4375. 
    *   Half of 0.4375 is 0.21875. 
    *   Half of 0.21875 is 0.109375. 
    *   Half of 0.109375 is 0.0546875. 
    *   Half of 0.0546875 is 0.02734375.

    *   Half of 1 is 0.5. 
    *   Half of 0.5 is 0.25. 
    *   Half of 0.25 is 0.125.
    *   Half of 0.125 is 0.0625. 
    *   Half of 0.0625 is 0.03125. 
    *   Half of 0.03125 is 0.015625. 

3.  **Starting Number: 144** 
    *   Half of 144 is 72. 
    *   Half of 72 is 36. 
    *   Half of 36 is 18. 
    *   Half of 18 is 9. 
    *   Half of 9 is 4.5.

##  Topic 1: Square Tricks Between 1 to 20

This video explains a simple method to find the square of numbers between 1 and 20 by using a multiplication technique.

**How it works:**

The method involves two steps:

1.  **Multiply the unit digits:** Multiply the unit digit of the number by itself. Write down the unit digit of this product and carry over the tens digit (if any).
2.  **Add and include the carry-over:** Add the original number to its unit digit. Then, add the carry-over from the previous step to this sum. Write down the result to complete the square.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: Find the square of 17**
    *   **Problem:** $17 \times 17$
    *   **Step 1:** Multiply the unit digits: $7 \times 7 = 49$.
        *   Write down `9`.
        *   Carry over `4`.
    *   **Step 2:** Add the original number to its unit digit: $17 + 7 = 24$.
        *   Add the carry-over: $24 + 4 = 28$.
        *   Write down `28`.
    *   **Result:** $17 \times 17 = 289$

*   **Example 2: Find the square of 7**
    *   **Problem:** $7 \times 7$
    *   **Step 1:** Multiply the unit digits: $7 \times 7 = 49$.
        *   Write down `9`.
        *   Carry over `4`.
    *   **Step 2:** Add the original number to its unit digit: $7 + 7 = 14$.
        *   Add the carry-over: $14 + 4 = 18$.
        *   Write down `18`.
    *   **Result:** $7 \times 7 = 49$ (The video incorrectly shows 49 as the answer after performing the full trick, it directly writes 49. The trick logic would lead to 189 if a carry-over was applied, but for single-digit squares, it's just direct multiplication).

*   **Example 3: Find the square of 12**
    *   **Problem:** $12 \times 12$
    *   **Step 1:** Multiply the unit digits: $2 \times 2 = 4$.
        *   Write down `4`.
        *   Carry over `0` (since there's no tens digit).
    *   **Step 2:** Add the original number to its unit digit: $12 + 2 = 14$.
        *   Add the carry-over: $14 + 0 = 14$.
        *   Write down `14`.
    *   **Result:** $12 \times 12 = 144$

*   **Example 4: Find the square of 18**
    *   **Problem:** $18 \times 18$
    *   **Step 1:** Multiply the unit digits: $8 \times 8 = 64$.
        *   Write down `4`.
        *   Carry over `6`.
    *   **Step 2:** Add the original number to its unit digit: $18 + 8 = 26$.
        *   Add the carry-over: $26 + 6 = 32$.
        *   Write down `32`.
    *   **Result:** $18 \times 18 = 324$

**Note:** The video also briefly mentions $8 \times 8 = 64$ and $9 \times 9 = 81$ as basic known squares. The trick is primarily demonstrated for two-digit numbers (like 12, 17, 18) within the 1-20 range where it offers a structured approach beyond rote memorization for some.

## Topic 2: Square Root Trick

This trick demonstrates a quick method to find the square root of a four-digit number.

*How it works:*

1.  *Memorize squares up to 10:* This method relies on knowing the squares of numbers from 1 to 10 and, specifically, their last digits.
    *   $1^2 = 1$
    *   $2^2 = 4$
    *   $3^2 = 9$
    *   $4^2 = 16$
    *   $5^2 = 25$
    *   $6^2 = 36$
    *   $7^2 = 49$
    *   $8^2 = 64$
    *   $9^2 = 81$
    *   $10^2 = 100$

2.  *Group last digits:* Observe which numbers have the same last digit in their squares. This helps in identifying the possible last digit of the square root.
    *   Numbers ending in 1: 1 and 9 (since $1^2=1$, $9^2=81$)
    *   Numbers ending in 4: 2 and 8 (since $2^2=4$, $8^2=64$)
    *   Numbers ending in 9: 3 and 7 (since $3^2=9$, $7^2=49$)
    *   Numbers ending in 6: 4 and 6 (since $4^2=16$, $6^2=36$)
    *   Numbers ending in 5: 5 (since $5^2=25$)

3.  *Split the number:* From the right, separate the given number into two parts. The first part will consist of the last two digits, and the second part will consist of the remaining digits.

4.  *Determine the first digit of the square root:* Look at the first part (the leftmost digits). Find the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to this number. The square root of this perfect square will be the first digit of your answer.

5.  *Calculate the remainder:* Subtract the perfect square found in step 4 from the first part of the number. This is your remainder.

6.  *Determine the second digit of the square root:*
    *   Look at the last digit of the original number. This will tell you the possible last digits of the square root (from the groupings in step 2).
    *   Compare the remainder (from step 5) with the first digit of your square root (from step 4).
        *   If the remainder is *smaller* than the first digit, choose the *smaller* of the two possible last digits (from the grouping).
        *   If the remainder is *equal to or larger* than the first digit, choose the *larger* of the two possible last digits.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{6084}$
    *   1. Split: 60 | 84
    *   2. First part (60): $7^2 = 49$, $8^2 = 64$. Since $49 \le 60 < 64$, the first digit is 7.
    *   3. Remainder: $60 - 49 = 11$.
    *   4. Last digit of original number (4): The square root ends in 2 or 8.
    *   5. Compare remainder (11) with first digit (7): $11 > 7$. So, choose the larger of 2 and 8, which is 8.
    *   *Result:* 78

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{1296}$
    *   1. Split: 12 | 96
    *   2. First part (12): $3^2 = 9$, $4^2 = 16$. Since $9 \le 12 < 16$, the first digit is 3.
    *   3. Remainder: $12 - 9 = 3$.
    *   4. Last digit of original number (6): The square root ends in 4 or 6.
    *   5. Compare remainder (3) with first digit (3): $3 = 3$. So, choose the larger of 4 and 6, which is 6.
    *   *Result:* 36

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{3969}$
    *   1. Split: 39 | 69
    *   2. First part (39): $6^2 = 36$, $7^2 = 49$. Since $36 \le 39 < 49$, the first digit is 6.
    *   3. Remainder: $39 - 36 = 3$.
    *   4. Last digit of original number (9): The square root ends in 3 or 7.
    *   5. Compare remainder (3) with first digit (6): $3 < 6$. So, choose the smaller of 3 and 7, which is 3.
    *   *Result:* 63

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is effective for finding the square roots of perfect squares, especially four-digit numbers.
*   Practice is essential to quickly recall the squares and last-digit groupings.
*   This method relies on observation and a few simple comparisons rather than complex calculations.

## Topic3: Square of Numbers Starting with 5

This trick provides a shortcut for finding the square of numbers that start with the digit 5.

*How it works for two-digit numbers (e.g., 5X):*

1.  *Square the units digit:* Take the units digit (X) and square it. If the result is a single digit (e.g., $2^2=4$), write it as two digits by adding a leading zero (e.g., 04).
2.  *Square the tens digit (5) and add the units digit:* Square the digit 5 (which is 25) and then add the units digit (X) to this result.
3.  *Combine the results:* Place the result from step 2 before the two-digit result from step 1.

*How it works for three-digit numbers (e.g., 5XX):*

1.  *Square the last two digits:* Take the last two digits (XX) and square them. This will typically result in a three-digit number.
2.  *Square the first digit (5) and add the second digit:* Square the digit 5 (which is 25) and then add the second digit (X) to this result.
3.  *Combine the results:* Place the result from step 2 before the three-digit result from step 1.

    2.  $5^2 + 4 = 25 + 4 = 29$.
    3.  Combine: $2916$.
    *Result: $2916$*

*   **Example 5: $508 \times 508$ (or $508^2$)**
    1.  Last two digits squared: $08 \times 08 = 64$. Write as $064$ (three digits for three-digit numbers).
    2.  First digit squared + second digit: $5^2 + 0 = 25 + 0 = 25$.
    3.  Combine: $258064$.
    *Result: $258064$*

*   **Example 6: $514 \times 514$ (or $514^2$)**
    1.  Last two digits squared: $14 \times 14 = 196$.
    2.  First digit squared + second digit: $5^2 + 1 = 25 + 1 = 26$.
    3.  Combine: $264196$.
    *Result: $264196$*

*   **Example 7: $523 \times 523$ (or $523^2$)**

*   For three-digit numbers, the squared last two digits are represented by three places (e.g., $8^2=064$).
*   It significantly speeds up the calculation of squares for these numbers, especially useful in competitive exams.
*   It is important to memorize squares up to at least 30 for efficient use of this trick with three-digit numbers.


## Topic 4: Near 300 Multiplication Trick

This trick is for quickly multiplying two numbers that are close to 300. It leverages a base-multiplication method similar to those used for numbers near 100 or 200, with an additional step of multiplying by 3.

*How it works:*

1.  **Identify the last two digits:** For each number, take the last two digits (which represent how much the number is above 300).
    *   Example: For 304, the last two digits are 04. For 318, they are 18.

2.  **Multiply the last two digits:** Multiply these two-digit numbers together.
    *   Example 1: $04 \times 18 = 72$
    *   Example 2: $16 \times 12 = 192$
    *   Example 3: $06 \times 05 = 30$

3.  **Record the rightmost part of the answer:**
    *   If the product from Step 2 is a two-digit number, write it down as the rightmost two digits of your final answer.
    *   If the product is a three-digit number, write down the last two digits and carry over the first digit.
    *   Example 1: Product is 72. Write `72`.
    *   Example 2: Product is 192. Write `92` and carry over `1`.
    *   Example 3: Product is 30. Write `30`.

4.  **Add the numbers diagonally:** Take the first number and add the last two digits of the second number to it (or vice-versa).
    *   Example 1: $304 + 18 = 322$ (or $318 + 04 = 322$)
    *   Example 2: $316 + 12 = 328$ (or $312 + 16 = 328$)
    *   Example 3: $306 + 05 = 311$ (or $305 + 06 = 311$)

5.  **Multiply by 3:** Since the base is 300, multiply the sum from Step 4 by 3.
    *   Example 1: $322 \times 3 = 966$
    *   Example 2: $328 \times 3 = 984$
    *   Example 3: $311 \times 3 = 933$

6.  **Combine and add carry-over:** Combine the result from Step 5 with the result from Step 3, remembering to add any carry-over.
    *   Example 1: No carry-over. $966$ and $72 \Rightarrow 96672$.
    *   Example 2: Carry-over 1. $984 + 1 = 985$. Combine with $92 \Rightarrow 98592$.
    *   Example 3: No carry-over. $933$ and $30 \Rightarrow 93330$.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Problem 1:** $304 \times 318$
    1.  Last two digits: 04 and 18.
    2.  Multiply: $04 \times 18 = 72$.
    3.  Rightmost part: `72` (no carry-over).
    4.  Add diagonally: $304 + 18 = 322$.
    5.  Multiply by 3: $322 \times 3 = 966$.
    6.  Combine: $96672$.
    *   **Result:** $96672$

*   **Problem 2:** $316 \times 312$
    1.  Last two digits: 16 and 12.
    2.  Multiply: $16 \times 12 = 192$.
    3.  Rightmost part: `92` (carry-over `1`).
    4.  Add diagonally: $316 + 12 = 328$.
    5.  Multiply by 3: $328 \times 3 = 984$.
    6.  Combine: Add carry-over to $984 \Rightarrow 984 + 1 = 985$. Then combine with `92`. $\Rightarrow 98592$.
    *   **Result:** $98592$

*   **Problem 3:** $306 \times 305$
    1.  Last two digits: 06 and 05.
    2.  Multiply: $06 \times 05 = 30$.
    3.  Rightmost part: `30` (no carry-over).
    4.  Add diagonally: $306 + 05 = 311$.
    5.  Multiply by 3: $311 \times 3 = 933$.
    6.  Combine: $93330$.
    *   **Result:** $93330$

*Key Points:*
*   This trick is specifically for numbers slightly *above* 300.
*   The multiplication by 3 is crucial because 300 is 3 times 100, which is the base of the two-digit numbers being handled in the initial steps.
*   Practice with multiplication tables up to 20 for faster mental calculation of the initial product.

*   Remember to handle the carried-over digits correctly.

## Topic 7: Square Trick Near 200

This trick provides a shortcut for finding the square of numbers near 200 (specifically, numbers between 200 and 300).

*How it works:*

Let the number be $200 + d$, where $d$ is the difference from 200.
We want to calculate $(200 + d)^2$.

1.  **Calculate the square of the difference:**
    *   Take the last two digits of the number (which represent 'd' if the number is $200+d$).
    *   Square this two-digit number: $d \times d = d^2$.
    *   Write down the last two digits of $d^2$. If $d^2$ is a three-digit number, carry over the hundreds digit. If $d^2$ is a single-digit number, write it as "0X".

2.  **Calculate the sum and double it:**
    *   Add the difference 'd' to the original number: $(200 + d) + d = 200 + 2d$.
    *   Double this sum: $2 \times (200 + 2d)$.
    *   Add any carried-over digit from step 1 to this doubled sum.
    *   Write this result to the left of the digits obtained in step 1.

*General Formula:*
For a number $N = 200 + d$:
$$ N^2 = (200 + d)^2 $$
1.  Calculate $d^2$. Write the last two digits and carry over any hundreds digit.
2.  Calculate $(200 + d + d) \times 2 = (200 + 2d) \times 2$. Add the carried-over digit.
3.  Combine the results from step 2 and step 1.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1: $204 \times 204$**
    1.  *Identify 'd':* The last two digits are 04, so $d=4$.
    2.  *Square 'd':* $4 \times 4 = 16$. Write down `16`. No carry-over.
    3.  *Add 'd' to the number and double:* $(204 + 4) = 208$.
    4.  *Double the sum:* $208 \times 2 = 416$.
    5.  *Combine:* $416$ followed by $16$.
    *   *Result:* $\mathbf{41616}$

*   **Example 2: $245 \times 245$**
    1.  *Identify 'd':* The last two digits are 45, so $d=45$.
    2.  *Square 'd':* $45 \times 45 = 2025$. Write down `25`. Carry over `20`.
    3.  *Add 'd' to the number and double:* $(245 + 45) = 290$.
    4.  *Double the sum:* $290 \times 2 = 580$.
    5.  *Add carry-over:* $580 + 20 = 600$.
    6.  *Combine:* $600$ followed by $25$.
    *   *Result:* $\mathbf{60025}$

*   **Example 3: $214 \times 214$**
    1.  *Identify 'd':* The last two digits are 14, so $d=14$.
    2.  *Square 'd':* $14 \times 14 = 196$. Write down `96`. Carry over `1`.
    3.  *Add 'd' to the number and double:* $(214 + 14) = 228$.
    4.  *Double the sum:* $228 \times 2 = 456$.
    5.  *Add carry-over:* $456 + 1 = 457$.
    6.  *Combine:* $457$ followed by $96$.
    *   *Result:* $\mathbf{45796}$

*Key Points:*
*   This trick is specifically designed for squaring numbers *near* 200.
*   "Near 200" implies numbers like 201, 202, ..., up to 299.
*   The first step (squaring the last two digits) requires knowing squares of numbers up to 99, or a method to calculate them quickly.
*   The crucial part is remembering to double the sum $(200+2d)$ and add any carry-over from the square of 'd'.


## Topic 8: Cube Root of 6 Digit Numbers

This trick provides a shortcut for finding the cube root of 6-digit numbers.

### Step 1: Memorize cubes from 1 to 10

To use this trick, you need to know the cubes of numbers from 1 to 10 by heart:

2.  *Separate the last two digits:* For a number like 105, separate the last two digits, which is '05'. (If it's a single digit like 8 in 108, treat it as '08').

3.  *Square the last two digits:* Multiply the last two digits by themselves.
    *   Example 1: For 105, $05 \times 05 = 25$. Write down "25".
    *   Example 2: For 114, $14 \times 14 = 196$. Write down "96" and carry over the "1".
    *   Example 3: For 108, $08 \times 08 = 64$. Write down "64".

4.  *Add the last two digits to the original number:* Take the original number and add the last two digits (the ones that were squared) to it.
    *   Example 1: For 105, $105 + 05 = 110$.
    *   Example 2: For 114, $114 + 14 = 128$.
    *   Example 3: For 108, $108 + 08 = 116$.

5.  *Combine the results:*
    *   For Example 1 (105): Combine "110" and "25" to get 11025.
    *   For Example 2 (114): Combine the sum from step 4 ($128$) with the carry-over from step 3 ($1$). $128 + 1 = 129$. Then combine "129" with "96" to get 12996.

*   Practice is key to performing these steps quickly and accurately, especially the mental calculations and carry-overs.

## Topic 12: Cube Root of 9 Digit Numbers Trick

This trick allows you to quickly find the cube root of a 9-digit number.

*How it works:*

1.  **Memorize cubes 1 to 10:**
    *   1³ = 1
    *   2³ = 8
    *   3³ = 27
    *   4³ = 64
    *   5³ = 125
    *   6³ = 216
    *   7³ = 343
    *   8³ = 512
    *   9³ = 729
    *   10³ = 1000

2.  **Divide the number into three portions:** Starting from the right side, divide the 9-digit number into three groups of three digits each.
    *   Example: For 37,79,33,067, the portions are 377 | 933 | 067.

3.  **Find the last digit of the cube root:** Look at the last digit of the rightmost portion (067 in the example). Find which cube from your memorized list ends with this digit (7).
    *   In 067, the last digit is 7. The cube that ends in 7 is 3³ = 27. So, the last digit of the cube root is 3.

4.  **Find the first digit of the cube root:** Look at the leftmost portion (377 in the example). Find which two cubes from your memorized list this number falls between. The first digit of the cube root will be the smaller of the base numbers of those cubes.
    *   377 falls between 7³ = 343 and 8³ = 512. The smaller base number is 7. So, the first digit of the cube root is 7.

5.  **Find the middle digit of the cube root:**
    *   Take the rightmost portion (067 in the example).
    *   Subtract the cube of the last digit you found (3³ = 27) from it: 067 - 27 = 040.
    *   Take the middle digit of this result (4 in 040).
    *   Use the formula: 3 * (last digit of cube root)² * (middle digit of cube root) = (middle digit from subtraction).
    *   Let S be the middle digit of the cube root. The formula becomes 3 * 3² * S = 4.
    *   3 * 9 * S = 4  => 27 * S = 4.
    *   Now, look at the units digit of 27 (which is 7). Find what single digit (S) multiplied by 7 gives a units digit of 4.
    *   7 * 2 = 14 (ends in 4). So, S = 2.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: Find the cube root of 37,79,33,067
    *   Step 1: Divide: 377 | 933 | 067
    *   Step 2: Last digit: 067 ends in 7. 3³ = 27, so the last digit of the cube root is 3.
    *   Step 3: First digit: 377 is between 7³ (343) and 8³ (512). The smaller base is 7. So, the first digit is 7.
    *   Step 4: Middle digit:
        *   067 - 3³ (27) = 040. The middle digit is 4.
        *   Formula: 3 * (last digit)² * S = 4 (units digit).
        *   3 * 3² * S = 4
        *   27 * S = 4
        *   7 * S = 4 (considering units digit)
        *   S = 2 (since 7 * 2 = 14, which ends in 4).
    *   Result: 723

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: Find the cube root of 3,24,61,759
    *   Step 1: Divide: 32 | 461 | 759
    *   Step 2: Last digit: 759 ends in 9. 9³ = 729, so the last digit of the cube root is 9.
    *   Step 3: First digit: 32 is between 3³ (27) and 4³ (64). The smaller base is 3. So, the first digit is 3.
    *   Step 4: Middle digit:
        *   759 - 9³ (729) = 030. The middle digit is 3.
        *   Formula: 3 * (last digit)² * S = 3 (units digit).
        *   3 * 9² * S = 3
        *   3 * 81 * S = 3
        *   3 * 1 * S = 3 (considering units digit)
        *   3 * S = 3
        *   S = 1.
    *   Result: 319

*Key Points:*

*   This trick relies heavily on memorizing the cubes of numbers from 1 to 10.
*   The division into three digit portions from the right is crucial.
*   The formula for the middle digit helps determine the second digit of the cube root.
*   Practice is essential to perform these steps quickly and accurately.

## Topic 13: Non-Perfect Square Root Trick

This trick provides an approximate method to calculate the square root of non-perfect square numbers, typically accurate to one decimal place, which is often sufficient for competitive exams or quick estimations.

*How it works:*

1.  **Identify the closest perfect square:** For the given number (let's call it $N$), find the closest perfect square number. Let this perfect square be $X^2$, where $X$ is its integer square root.
    *   If $N > X^2$, then $N = X^2 + \text{remainder}$.
    *   If $N < X^2$, then $N = X^2 - \text{remainder}$. (The video primarily focuses on $N > X^2$ examples, but the principle can be adapted).

2.  **Formulate the approximation:** The approximate square root of $N$ can be calculated using the formula:
    $$ \sqrt{N} \approx X + \frac{\text{remainder}}{2X} $$
    Where:
    *   $X$ is the integer square root of the closest perfect square ($X^2$).
    *   "remainder" is the difference between $N$ and $X^2$.
    *   $2X$ is double the value of $X$.

3.  **Perform the division:** Divide the remainder by $2X$ and add the result (as a decimal) to $X$.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1: Square root of 19**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{19}$
    *   1.  Closest perfect square to 19 is 16.
        *   $X^2 = 16 \implies X = 4$
    *   2.  Remainder: $19 - 16 = 3$
    *   3.  Apply the formula: $\sqrt{19} \approx 4 + \frac{3}{2 \times 4}$
        *   $\sqrt{19} \approx 4 + \frac{3}{8}$
    *   4.  Convert fraction to decimal (approx. one decimal place):
        *   $3 \div 8 = 0.375 \approx 0.3$ (rounding down as per video's result)
    *   *Result:* $\sqrt{19} \approx 4.3$

*   **Example 2: Square root of 31**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{31}$
    *   1.  Closest perfect square to 31 is 25.
        *   $X^2 = 25 \implies X = 5$
    *   2.  Remainder: $31 - 25 = 6$
    *   3.  Apply the formula: $\sqrt{31} \approx 5 + \frac{6}{2 \times 5}$
        *   $\sqrt{31} \approx 5 + \frac{6}{10}$
    *   4.  Convert fraction to decimal:
        *   $6 \div 10 = 0.6$
    *   *Result:* $\sqrt{31} \approx 5.6$

*   **Example 3: Square root of 23**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{23}$
    *   1.  Closest perfect square to 23 is 16.
        *   $X^2 = 16 \implies X = 4$
    *   2.  Remainder: $23 - 16 = 7$
    *   3.  Apply the formula: $\sqrt{23} \approx 4 + \frac{7}{2 \times 4}$
        *   $\sqrt{23} \approx 4 + \frac{7}{8}$
    *   4.  Convert fraction to decimal (approx. one decimal place):
        *   $7 \div 8 = 0.875 \approx 0.8$ (rounding down as per video's result)
    *   *Result:* $\sqrt{23} \approx 4.8$

*Key Points:*

*   This trick provides an estimation, not an exact value. The accuracy is generally good for one decimal place.
*   It is particularly useful in exams where calculators are not allowed or when a quick approximation is needed.
*   The method works by linear approximation around the nearest perfect square.

This video explains the prime factorization method for finding the square root of numbers. The method involves breaking down a number into its prime factors and then grouping them to find the square root.

## Topic 14: Prime Factorisation Method

This method is useful for finding the square root of numbers, especially in competitive exams when dealing with problems involving finding perfect squares after addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. It's also applicable for finding the cube root, LCM, and HCF.

### How it works:

1.  **Prime Factorization:** Divide the given number by the smallest possible prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.) until the quotient is 1.
2.  **Pairing Factors:** For square roots, group identical prime factors into pairs.
3.  **Multiply one from each pair:** Take one number from each pair and multiply them together. The result is the square root of the original number.

### Examples from the video (with solutions):

1.  **Square root of 144**

    *   **Prime Factorization:**
        *   $144 \div 2 = 72$
        *   $72 \div 2 = 36$
        *   $36 \div 2 = 18$
        *   $18 \div 2 = 9$
        *   $9 \div 3 = 3$
        *   $3 \div 3 = 1$
        So, $144 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3$

    *   **Pairing and Multiplication:**
        *   Group the factors: $(2 \times 2) \times (2 \times 2) \times (3 \times 3)$
        *   Take one from each pair: $2 \times 2 \times 3$
        *   Multiply: $2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12$
    *   **Result:** The square root of 144 is 12.

2.  **Square root of 625**

    *   **Prime Factorization:**
        *   $625 \div 5 = 125$
        *   $125 \div 5 = 25$
        *   $25 \div 5 = 5$
        *   $5 \div 5 = 1$
        So, $625 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5$

    *   **Pairing and Multiplication:**
        *   Group the factors: $(5 \times 5) \times (5 \times 5)$
        *   Take one from each pair: $5 \times 5$
        *   Multiply: $5 \times 5 = 25$
    *   **Result:** The square root of 625 is 25.

3.  **Square root of 729**

    *   **Prime Factorization:**
        *   To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits: $7 + 2 + 9 = 18$. Since 18 is divisible by 3, 729 is divisible by 3.
        *   $729 \div 3 = 243$
        *   $243 \div 3 = 81$
        *   $81 \div 3 = 27$
        *   $27 \div 3 = 9$
        *   $9 \div 3 = 3$
        *   $3 \div 3 = 1$
        So, $729 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$

    *   **Pairing and Multiplication:**
        *   Group the factors: $(3 \times 3) \times (3 \times 3) \times (3 \times 3)$
        *   Take one from each pair: $3 \times 3 \times 3$
        *   Multiply: $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$
    *   **Result:** The square root of 729 is 27.

### Key Points:

*   Always divide by prime numbers, starting from the smallest (2).
*   For square roots, you need pairs of identical prime factors. If a number does not have all its prime factors in pairs, it is not a perfect square.
*   This method is foundational for various number theory problems and finding other roots (like cube roots, where you group factors in threes).

## Topic 15: Square Root - Long Division Method

This method is useful for finding the square root of numbers, especially for larger numbers or when determining what number to add or subtract to make a number a perfect square.

**How it works:**

1.  **Set up the division:** Write the number whose square root you want to find inside a division-like symbol.
2.  **Pair the digits:** Starting from the right (units place), group the digits in pairs. If the number of digits is odd, the leftmost digit will be a single pair.
    *   Example: For 1024, pair the digits as "10" and "24".
    *   Example: For 8281, pair the digits as "82" and "81".
3.  **Find the largest perfect square for the first pair:** Consider the leftmost pair (or single digit). Find the largest perfect square that is less than or equal to this number.
    *   Example 1 (1024): The first pair is 10. The largest perfect square less than or equal to 10 is 9 (which is $3^2$).
    *   Example 2 (8281): The first pair is 82. The largest perfect square less than or equal to 82 is 81 (which is $9^2$).
4.  **Write the root and subtract:**
    *   Write the square root of this perfect square above the first pair (this is the first digit of your answer).
    *   Write the perfect square itself below the first pair.
    *   Subtract this from the first pair.
    *   Example 1: Write '3' above 10. Write '9' below 10. Subtract $10 - 9 = 1$.
    *   Example 2: Write '9' above 82. Write '81' below 82. Subtract $82 - 81 = 1$.
5.  **Bring down the next pair:** Unlike regular division where you bring down one digit, in long division for square roots, you bring down the *entire next pair* of digits.
    *   Example 1: Bring down '24' next to 1, making it 124.
    *   Example 2: Bring down '81' next to 1, making it 181.
6.  **Double the current answer and append a blank:** Take the number currently in the answer (above the division line), double it, and write it down with a blank space next to it.
    *   Example 1: The current answer is 3. Double it to get 6. Write '6\_'.
    *   Example 2: The current answer is 9. Double it to get 18. Write '18\_'.
7.  **Find the next digit:** Fill the blank space with a digit such that when the resulting number (e.g., 6\_ ) is multiplied by that same digit, the product is less than or equal to the current remainder (e.g., 124).
    *   Example 1 (124): We have '6\_'.
        *   If we try 1: $61 \times 1 = 61$ (too small).
        *   If we try 2: $62 \times 2 = 124$ (perfect fit!).
    *   Example 2 (181): We have '18\_'.
        *   If we try 1: $181 \times 1 = 181$ (perfect fit!).
8.  **Write the digit, multiply, and subtract:**
    *   Write this digit in the blank space next to the doubled number.
    *   Write this same digit as the next digit of your answer (above the division line).
    *   Multiply the complete doubled number (e.g., 62) by the new digit (e.g., 2) and write the product below the remainder.
    *   Subtract.
    *   Example 1: Write '2' in '6\_' making it '62'. Write '2' next to '3' in the answer, making it '32'. Subtract $124 - 124 = 0$.
    *   Example 2: Write '1' in '18\_' making it '181'. Write '1' next to '9' in the answer, making it '91'. Subtract $181 - 181 = 0$.
9.  **Repeat if necessary:** If there are more pairs of digits, continue the process from step 5. If the remainder is 0 and no more pairs exist, you have found the exact square root. If there's a remainder or you need more precision, you can add pairs of zeros after a decimal point and continue.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: Square Root 1024**

    1.  Number: 1024
    2.  Pairs: 10, 24
    3.  First pair (10): Largest perfect square $\le 10$ is 9 ($3^2$).
    4.  Write 3 above 10. Subtract $10 - 9 = 1$.
    5.  Bring down 24, making it 124.
    6.  Double the current answer (3): $3 \times 2 = 6$. Write '6\_'.
    7.  Find next digit for 6\_: $62 \times 2 = 124$.
    8.  Write 2 in the blank and in the answer. Subtract $124 - 124 = 0$.
    9.  Remainder is 0.

    *Result:* $\sqrt{1024} = 32$

*   **Example 2: Square Root of 8281**

    1.  Number: 8281
    2.  Pairs: 82, 81
    3.  First pair (82): Largest perfect square $\le 82$ is 81 ($9^2$).
    4.  Write 9 above 82. Subtract $82 - 81 = 1$.
    5.  Bring down 81, making it 181.
    6.  Double the current answer (9): $9 \times 2 = 18$. Write '18\_'.
    7.  Find next digit for 18\_: $181 \times 1 = 181$.
    8.  Write 1 in the blank and in the answer. Subtract $181 - 181 = 0$.
    9.  Remainder is 0.

    *Result:* $\sqrt{8281} = 91$

**Key Points about the Long Division Method:**

*   This method is crucial for problems that ask what number needs to be *added* or *subtracted* from a given number to make it a perfect square (because the remainder directly tells you the "excess" or "deficit").
*   It works for any positive number, including those that are not perfect squares (by extending to decimal places).
*   Always pair digits from right to left.
*   Always bring down pairs of digits.
*   The divisor in each step is formed by doubling the current quotient and appending a new digit.

## Topic 17: Cube Root of 12-Digit Numbers

This trick provides a shortcut for finding the cube root of a 12-digit number.

*Prerequisite:* Memorize the cubes of numbers from 1 to 10:
*   $1^3 = 1$
*   $2^3 = 8$
*   $3^3 = 27$
*   $4^3 = 64$
*   $5^3 = 125$
*   $6^3 = 216$
*   $7^3 = 343$
*   $8^3 = 512$
*   $9^3 = 729$
*   $10^3 = 1000$

*How it works (for a 12-digit number):*

1.  **Divide the number into chunks of 3 digits from right to left:** For a 12-digit number, you will get 4 chunks. This means the cube root will be a 4-digit number.
    *   Example 1: $\sqrt[3]{454934040371}$ becomes `454 | 934 | 040 | 371`
    *   Example 2: $\sqrt[3]{150653691161}$ becomes `150 | 653 | 691 | 161`

2.  **Find the first digit (Leftmost digit):**
    *   Look at the leftmost chunk. Find the largest cube less than or equal to this chunk from your memorized list. The base of that cube is your first digit.
    *   Example 1: Leftmost chunk is `454`. $7^3 = 343$ and $8^3 = 512$. Since $343 \le 454 < 512$, the first digit is 7.
    *   Example 2: Leftmost chunk is `150`. $5^3 = 125$ and $6^3 = 216$. Since $125 \le 150 < 216$, the first digit is 5.

3.  **Find the last digit (Rightmost digit):**
    *   Look at the rightmost chunk. Identify its last digit. Find which of the cubes from 1 to 10 ends with that same last digit. The base of that cube is your last digit.
    *   Example 1: Rightmost chunk is `371`. Its last digit is 1. $1^3 = 1$, so the last digit is 1.
    *   Example 2: Rightmost chunk is `161`. Its last digit is 1. $1^3 = 1$, so the last digit is 1.

4.  **Find the third digit (using $3L^2T$):**
    *   Consider the rightmost chunk (e.g., `371` in Example 1). Take the middle digit of this chunk (e.g., 7).
    *   Use the formula $3L^2T$, where:
        *   $L$ is the last digit found in step 3 (e.g., 1).
        *   $T$ is the third digit you want to find.
    *   Set $3L^2T$ equal to the middle digit of the rightmost chunk.
    *   Solve for $T$ by finding the single digit that makes the product's last digit match.
    *   Example 1: Rightmost chunk is `371`. Middle digit is 7. Last digit $L=1$.
        *   $3 \times 1^2 \times T = 7 \quad \implies \quad 3T = 7$
        *   We need $3 \times T$ to end in 7.
        *   $3 \times 1 = 3$
        *   $3 \times 2 = 6$
        *   $3 \times 3 = 9$
        *   ...
        *   $3 \times 9 = 27$ (ends in 7). So, $T = 9$. The third digit is 9.
    *   Example 2: Rightmost chunk is `161`. Middle digit is 6. Last digit $L=1$.
        *   $3 \times 1^2 \times T = 6 \quad \implies \quad 3T = 6$
        *   We need $3 \times T$ to end in 6.
        *   $3 \times 2 = 6$. So, $T = 2$. The third digit is 2.

5.  **Find the second digit (using $3L^2S + 3LT^2$):**
    *   Consider the second-to-last chunk from the right (e.g., `040` in Example 1). Take its middle digit (e.g., 4).
    *   Use the formula $3L^2S + 3LT^2$, where:
        *   $L$ is the last digit found in step 3 (e.g., 1).
        *   $T$ is the third digit found in step 4 (e.g., 9).
        *   $S$ is the second digit you want to find.
    *   Set the result of $3L^2S + 3LT^2$ to the middle digit of the second-to-last chunk.
    *   Solve for $S$ by finding the single digit that makes the sum's last digit match.
    *   Example 1: Second-to-last chunk is `040`. Middle digit is 4. Last digit $L=1$, Third digit $T=9$.
        *   $3 \times 1^2 \times S + 3 \times 1 \times 9^2 = 4$ (We need the last digit to be 4)
        *   $3S + 3 \times 81 = 4$
        *   $3S + 243 = 4$
        *   Focus on the last digit: $3S + 3 = 4$
        *   $3S = 1$
        *   We need $3 \times S$ to end in 1.
        *   $3 \times 1 = 3$
        *   ...
        *   $3 \times 7 = 21$ (ends in 1). So, $S = 7$. The second digit is 7.
        *   *Correction from video:* The video makes a slight error in this step. It uses the "7" from the middle digit of `371` and subtracts 1 (from $1^3$) to get 370, then takes the 7. This is unconventional and less robust than working with the middle chunk directly. Let's follow a more standard approach for finding the middle digits.

    *   Let's re-evaluate the middle digits using a more consistent method, which involves the "remainder" from subtracting the cubes. This method is more involved and not as straightforward for a 12-digit number as the video implies. The video's method for the middle digits relies on matching the units digit of specific calculations with the units digit of the relevant chunk.

    *   **Revised approach for middle digits (following video's logic but ensuring consistency):**

    *   **Third digit:** Take the rightmost 3-digit group (e.g., `371`). Subtract the cube of the *last digit* (from the overall cube root). Then look at the middle digit of the remaining 2-digit number. This is what $3L^2T$ should match.
        *   Example 1: `371`. Last digit is 1. $1^3 = 1$. $371 - 1 = 370$. Middle digit is 7.
            *   $3 \times L^2 \times T = 7$ (unit digit)
            *   $3 \times 1^2 \times T = 7 \implies 3T = 7$. The unit digit of $3T$ must be 7.
            *   $T=9$ ($3 \times 9 = 27$). So, the third digit is 9.
        *   Example 2: `161`. Last digit is 1. $1^3 = 1$. $161 - 1 = 160$. Middle digit is 6.
            *   $3 \times L^2 \times T = 6$ (unit digit)
            *   $3 \times 1^2 \times T = 6 \implies 3T = 6$. The unit digit of $3T$ must be 6.
            *   $T=2$ ($3 \times 2 = 6$). So, the third digit is 2.

    *   **Second digit:** Take the second 3-digit group from the right (e.g., `040`). Subtract the units digit of $3L T^2$ (where $L$ is the last digit, $T$ is the third digit). Then take the units digit of the resulting two-digit number. This is what $3L^2S$ should match.
        *   Example 1: Second 3-digit group is `040`. Last digit $L=1$, Third digit $T=9$.
            *   $3LT^2 = 3 \times 1 \times 9^2 = 3 \times 81 = 243$. The unit digit is 3.
            *   Now consider the second 3-digit group: `040`. Take its middle digit which is 4.
            *   We need $3L^2S + \text{unit digit of } 3LT^2 = 4$.
            *   $3 \times 1^2 \times S + 3 = 4 \implies 3S + 3 = 4$.
            *   $3S = 1$. We need $3 \times S$ to end in 1.
            *   $S=7$ ($3 \times 7 = 21$). So, the second digit is 7.
        *   Example 2: Second 3-digit group is `691`. Last digit $L=1$, Third digit $T=2$.
            *   $3LT^2 = 3 \times 1 \times 2^2 = 3 \times 4 = 12$. The unit digit is 2.
            *   Now consider the second 3-digit group: `691`. Take its middle digit which is 9.
            *   We need $3L^2S + \text{unit digit of } 3LT^2 = 9$.
            *   $3 \times 1^2 \times S + 2 = 9 \implies 3S + 2 = 9$.
            *   $3S = 7$. We need $3 \times S$ to end in 7.
            *   $S=9$ ($3 \times 9 = 27$). So, the second digit is 9.

*Results from the video:*

*   **Example 1:** Cube root of 454934040371
    *   First digit: 7
    *   Second digit: 6 (The video's calculation for this digit is different from the derivation shown, indicating a potential simplification or an error in explanation for the derivation part. Let's assume the video's final answer for the second digit is correct based on the overall problem's context.)

    *   **Final Answer from video:** 7691

*   **Example 2:** Cube root of 150653691161
    *   First digit: 5
    *   Second digit: 3 (Again, the video's derivation logic for this digit seems simplified or slightly altered from standard methods. Assuming the final answer is given.)
    *   Third digit: 2
    *   Last digit: 1
    *   **Final Answer from video:** 5321

*Important Note:* The video's method for determining the middle digits is a simplified visual approach based on unit digits after specific subtractions. For larger numbers, it might not be immediately intuitive or directly match standard algebraic derivations of cube root algorithms. The key takeaway from the video is the pattern of unit digits and relative magnitude for the first and last digits, combined with a quick way to find the inner digits based on units-digit matching. Practice with many examples is crucial to grasp the specific nuances of this "trick."

## Topic 18: Decimal Addition

This video explains how to perform decimal addition, focusing on the correct placement of the decimal point.

*How it works:*

1.  *Understanding Place Values with Decimals:*
    *   For whole numbers (left of the decimal point), place values are Ones, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, etc.
    *   For decimal numbers (right of the decimal point), place values are Tenths ($10^{-1}$ or $\frac{1}{10}$), Hundredths ($10^{-2}$ or $\frac{1}{100}$), Thousandths ($10^{-3}$ or $\frac{1}{1000}$), and so on.
    *   When reading decimal numbers, digits after the decimal point are read individually (e.g., 5916.3256 is read as "five thousand nine hundred sixteen *point* three two five six", not "three thousand two hundred fifty-six").

2.  *Setting up for Addition:*
    *   The crucial step is to align the decimal points of all numbers vertically.
    *   If numbers have a different number of digits after the decimal point, you can add trailing zeros to the shorter numbers to make them all have the same number of decimal places. This doesn't change their value (e.g., 63.5 is the same as 63.50).

3.  *Performing Addition:*
    *   Add the numbers column by column, starting from the rightmost digit, just like regular addition.
    *   Carry over digits to the next column when a sum exceeds 9.
    *   Place the decimal point in the sum directly below the aligned decimal points of the numbers being added.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $228.2 + 293.5$
    *   Setup:
        ```
          228.2
        + 293.5
        -------
        ```
    *   Calculation:
        ```
          228.2
        + 293.5
        -------
          521.7
        ```

        ```
    *   *Result:* $631.8$

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $382.6 + 823.6$
    *   Setup:
        ```
          382.6
        + 823.6
        -------
        ```
    *   Calculation:
        ```
          382.6
        + 823.6
        -------
         1206.2
        ```
    *   *Result:* $1206.2$

*   *Example 4 (with varying decimal places):*
    *   Problem: $63.5 + 8.41$
    *   Setup: Align decimal points and add a zero to 63.5
        ```
          63.50
        +  8.41
        -------
        ```
    *   Calculation:
        ```
          63.50
        +  8.41
        -------
          71.91
        ```
    *   *Result:* $71.91$

*   *Example 5 (with varying decimal places):*
    *   Problem: $13.64 + 8.8$
    *   Setup: Align decimal points and add a zero to 8.8
        ```
          13.64
        +  8.80
        -------
        ```
    *   Calculation:
        ```
          13.64
        +  8.80
        -------
          22.44
        ```
    *   *Result:* $22.44$

*   *Example 6 (multiple numbers, varying decimal places, and whole numbers):*
    *   Problem: $32.157 + 1.8 + 12 + 0.325$
    *   Setup: Align decimal points. Add zeros to 1.8 and 12 to match the number with most decimal places (3 decimal places).
        ```
          32.157
           1.800
          12.000
        +  0.325
        ---------
        ```
    *   Calculation:
        ```
          32.157
           1.800
          12.000
        +  0.325
        ---------
          46.282
        ```
    *   *Result:* $46.282$

*Key Points:*

*   Always align decimal points vertically.
*   Add trailing zeros to numbers with fewer decimal places to simplify alignment and addition, though it's not strictly necessary as an empty space is understood as zero.
*   Perform addition from right to left, carrying over digits as needed.
*   Place the decimal point in the result directly below the aligned decimal points.


## Topic 19: Decimal Subtraction

This section explains how to perform subtraction with decimal numbers. The key principle is to align the decimal points of the numbers and add zeros to ensure both numbers have the same number of decimal places.

**Key Steps for Decimal Subtraction:**

1.  **Align Decimal Points:** Write the numbers vertically, ensuring that their decimal points are directly aligned.
2.  **Equalize Decimal Places:** Add zeros to the right of the decimal point in the number with fewer decimal places until both numbers have the same number of decimal places. This step is crucial for accurate subtraction, as it ensures you are subtracting corresponding place values.
3.  **Perform Subtraction:** Subtract the numbers as you would with whole numbers, starting from the rightmost digit. If a digit in the top number is smaller than the corresponding digit in the bottom number, you will need to borrow from the digit to its left.
4.  **Place Decimal Point:** Place the decimal point in the result directly below the aligned decimal points in the numbers being subtracted.

**Examples from the Video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 18 - 0.8**
    *   **Step 1 & 2:** Write 18 as 18.000 (adding zeros to match the three decimal places in the next example for general good practice in the video, though 0.8 only has one decimal place) and 0.8 as 0.800.
        ```
        18.000
        - 0.800
        -------
        ```
    *   **Step 3:** Subtract the numbers.
        *   0 - 0 = 0
        *   0 - 0 = 0
        *   0 - 8: Borrow from the 8, making it 10. 10 - 8 = 2.
        *   The 8 becomes 7. 7 - 0 = 7.
        *   1 - 0 = 1.
        ```
        18.000
        - 0.800
        -------
        17.200
        ```
    *   **Result:** 17.2 (The trailing zeros after the decimal point are not significant and can be omitted).

*   **Example 2: 8 - 0.07**
    *   **Step 1 & 2:** Write 8 as 8.0000 (adding several zeros for clarity and avoiding errors, though 0.07 only has two decimal places). Write 0.07 as 0.0700.
        ```
        8.0000
        - 0.0700
        -------
        ```
    *   **Step 3:** Subtract the numbers, borrowing as needed.
        *   0 - 0 = 0 (Can be omitted if not adding extra zeros)
        *   0 - 0 = 0 (Can be omitted if not adding extra zeros)
        *   0 - 7: Borrow from the 8 (which becomes 7), making the first zero 10. Then borrow from this 10 (making it 9) for the next zero, and then borrow again for the final zero, making it 10.
        *   10 - 7 = 3.
        *   The next zero to the left became 9. 9 - 0 = 9.
        *   The next zero became 9. 9 - 0 = 9.
        *   The 8 became 7. 7 - 0 = 7.
        ```
        7.993
        ```
    *   **Result:** 7.93

*   **Example 3: 12 - 0.0003**
    *   **Step 1 & 2:** Write 12 as 12.000000. Write 0.0003 as 0.0003.
        ```
        12.000000
        - 0.000300
        -----------
        ```
    *   **Step 3:** Subtract the numbers, borrowing from the leftmost non-zero digit.
        *   Borrow from the 2 in 12 (making it 1). The zeros become 9s until the last digit which becomes 10.
        *   10 - 3 = 7
        *   Next digit (originally 0) became 9. 9 - 0 = 9
        *   Next digit (originally 0) became 9. 9 - 0 = 9
        *   Next digit (originally 0) became 9. 9 - 0 = 9
        *   The 2 became 1. 1 - 0 = 1.
        *   The 1 remains 1. 1 - 0 = 1.
        ```
        11.9997
        ```
    *   **Result:** 11.9997

*   **Example 4: 3.45 - 1.7**
    *   **Step 1 & 2:** Write 3.45 and 1.70 (adding a zero to 1.7 to match decimal places).
        ```
        3.45
        - 1.70
        -------
        ```
    *   **Step 3:** Subtract the numbers.
        *   5 - 0 = 5
        *   4 - 7: Borrow from the 3 (making it 2). The 4 becomes 14. 14 - 7 = 7.
        *   The 3 became 2. 2 - 1 = 1.
        ```
        3.45
        - 1.70
        -------
        1.75
        ```
    *   **Result:** 1.75

*   **Example 5: 8 - 1.2**
    *   **Step 1 & 2:** Write 8 as 8.0000. Write 1.2 as 1.2000.
        ```
        8.0000
        - 1.2000
        -------
        ```
    *   **Step 3:** Subtract the numbers.
        *   0 - 0 = 0
        *   0 - 0 = 0
        *   0 - 0 = 0
        *   0 - 2: Borrow from the 8 (making it 7). The 0 becomes 10. 10 - 2 = 8.
        *   The 8 became 7. 7 - 1 = 6.
        ```
        8.0000
        - 1.2000
        -------
        6.8000
        ```
    *   **Result:** 6.8

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Decimal Alignment:** Always ensure the decimal points are aligned vertically before subtracting.
*   **Adding Zeros:** Adding trailing zeros after the decimal point does not change the value of a number but helps in aligning place values for subtraction, preventing errors.
*   **Borrowing:** Follow standard borrowing rules when a digit in the minuend (top number) is smaller than the corresponding digit in the subtrahend (bottom number).
*   **Practice:** Consistent practice is essential to master decimal subtraction.


This video discusses two rules for the subtraction of fractions:

## Topic 20: Subtraction of Fractions Rule 1 (Same Denominator)
If the denominators of the fractions are the same, simply subtract the numerators and keep the common denominator.

**How it works:**
1.  Identify the denominators.
2.  If the denominators are equal, keep that denominator.
3.  Subtract the numerators.

**General Formula:**
$$ \frac{A}{D} - \frac{B}{D} = \frac{A - B}{D} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{5}{6} - \frac{4}{6} $$
    *   Denominators: Both are 6.
    *   Numerators: $5 - 4 = 1$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{1}{6} $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{9}{10} - \frac{8}{10} $$
    *   Denominators: Both are 10.
    *   Numerators: $9 - 8 = 1$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{1}{10} $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{5}{9} - \frac{3}{9} $$
    *   Denominators: Both are 9.
    *   Numerators: $5 - 3 = 2$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{2}{9} $$

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{14}{15} - \frac{6}{15} $$
    *   Denominators: Both are 15.
    *   Numerators: $14 - 6 = 8$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{8}{15} $$

*   **Example 5:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{6}{7} - \frac{4}{7} $$
    *   Denominators: Both are 7.
    *   Numerators: $6 - 4 = 2$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{2}{7} $$

*   **Example 6:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{11}{12} - \frac{10}{12} $$
    *   Denominators: Both are 12.
    *   Numerators: $11 - 10 = 1$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{1}{12} $$

*   **Example 7:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{12}{14} - \frac{7}{14} $$
    *   Denominators: Both are 14.
    *   Numerators: $12 - 7 = 5$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{5}{14} $$

##  Subtraction of Fractions Rule 2 (Different Denominators - Method 1: Cross-multiplication)
When the denominators are different, one way to subtract fractions is using cross-multiplication. This method is suitable for subtracting two fractions.

**How it works:**
1.  Multiply the denominators to get the new common denominator.
2.  Cross-multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction.
3.  Cross-multiply the numerator of the second fraction by the denominator of the first fraction.
4.  Subtract the results from steps 2 and 3 to get the new numerator.

**General Formula:**
$$ \frac{A}{B} - \frac{C}{D} = \frac{(A \times D) - (C \times B)}{B \times D} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{7}{8} - \frac{3}{4} $$
    *   New Denominator: $8 \times 4 = 32$.
    *   Cross-multiplied numerators: $(7 \times 4) - (3 \times 8) = 28 - 24 = 4$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{4}{32} $$

## Subtraction of Fractions Rule 3 (Different Denominators - Method 2: LCM/Common Multiple)
Another method for subtracting fractions with different denominators is to find a common multiple (or the least common multiple, LCM) of the denominators. This method is generally more robust, especially when dealing with more than two fractions.

**How it works:**
1.  Find a common multiple (preferably the LCM) of the denominators. This will be the new common denominator.
2.  For each fraction, divide the new common denominator by its original denominator.
3.  Multiply the result from step 2 by the original numerator of that fraction. This gives the new numerator for each fraction.
4.  Subtract the new numerators, keeping the common denominator.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**
*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{3}{5} - \frac{3}{10} $$
    *   Common Multiple of 5 and 10: 50.
    *   New Numerator 1: $(50 \div 5) \times 3 = 10 \times 3 = 30$.
    *   New Numerator 2: $(50 \div 10) \times 3 = 5 \times 3 = 15$.
    *   Subtract New Numerators: $30 - 15 = 15$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{15}{50} $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{3} $$
    *   Common Multiple of 4 and 3: 12.
    *   New Numerator 1: $(12 \div 4) \times 3 = 3 \times 3 = 9$.
    *   New Numerator 2: $(12 \div 3) \times 1 = 4 \times 1 = 4$.
    *   Subtract New Numerators: $9 - 4 = 5$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{5}{12} $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{7}{8} - \frac{3}{4} $$
    *   Common Multiple of 8 and 4: 32.
    *   New Numerator 1: $(32 \div 8) \times 7 = 4 \times 7 = 28$.
    *   New Numerator 2: $(32 \div 4) \times 3 = 8 \times 3 = 24$.
    *   Subtract New Numerators: $28 - 24 = 4$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{4}{32} $$

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{4}{6} - \frac{1}{12} $$
    *   Common Multiple of 6 and 12: 72.
    *   New Numerator 1: $(72 \div 6) \times 4 = 12 \times 4 = 48$.
    *   New Numerator 2: $(72 \div 12) \times 1 = 6 \times 1 = 6$.
    *   Subtract New Numerators: $48 - 6 = 42$.
    *   *Result:* $$ \frac{42}{72} $$

The instructor recommends using Rule 3 (LCM/Common Multiple method) as it is more versatile for cases with more than two fractions, while Rule 2 (cross-multiplication) is efficient for two fractions. The key is consistent practice to increase speed.

## Topic 21: Addition of Fractions

This lesson explains how to add fractions, focusing on cases where the denominators are equal and cases where they are different.

*Key Concepts:*

*   **Fraction Structure:** A fraction has two parts:
    *   **Numerator:** The top number (അംശം in Malayalam).
    *   **Denominator:** The bottom number (ഛേദം in Malayalam).
*   **Rules for Addition/Subtraction of Fractions:** The primary rule depends on the denominators.
    *   **Equal Denominators:** If all fractions have the same denominator, simply add (or subtract) the numerators and keep the denominator the same.
    *   **Unequal Denominators:** If the denominators are different, they must be made equal before adding or subtracting. This typically involves finding a common multiple or using a cross-multiplication method.
*   **Mixed Fractions:** If the numerator of the resulting fraction is larger than the denominator, it can be converted into a mixed fraction (a whole number and a proper fraction).

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

**Case 1: Equal Denominators**

1.  *Problem:* $$\frac{3}{5} + \frac{2}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = $$
    *   *Solution:* Denominators are all 5. Add the numerators: $3+2+1 = 6$.
    *   *Result:* $$\frac{6}{5}$$
    *   *Mixed Fraction Conversion (since numerator > denominator):* $6 \div 5 = 1$ with a remainder of $1$. So, $$1 \frac{1}{5}$$

2.  *Problem:* $$\frac{1}{5} + \frac{2}{5} + \frac{1}{5} = $$
    *   *Solution:* Denominators are all 5. Add the numerators: $1+2+1 = 4$.
    *   *Result:* $$\frac{4}{5}$$
    *   *Note:* Cannot be converted to a mixed fraction as the numerator is smaller than the denominator.

3.  *Problem:* $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = $$
    *   *Solution:* Denominators are all 2. Add the numerators: $1+2+1 = 4$.
    *   *Result:* $$\frac{4}{2} = 2$$
    *   *Alternative approach:* $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$. Then $1 + \frac{2}{2} = 1+1 = 2$.

4.  *Problem:* $$\frac{5}{9} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{3}{9} = $$
    *   *Solution:* Denominators are all 9. Add the numerators: $5+1+3 = 9$.
    *   *Result:* $$\frac{9}{9} = 1$$

**Case 2: Unequal Denominators (using a "shortcut" method, similar to finding a common denominator by multiplying)**

*Method Explained:*
1.  Multiply all the denominators together to get a common denominator for the result.
2.  For each fraction:
    *   Divide the common denominator (from step 1) by the fraction's original denominator.
    *   Multiply this result by the fraction's numerator.
    *   Add (or subtract) these new numerator values.

*Examples from the video:*

1.  *Problem:* $$\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{5} + \frac{1}{3} = $$
    *   *Denominators:* 4, 5, 3
    *   *Common Denominator (multiply them):* $4 \times 5 \times 3 = 60$
    *   *New Numerators:*
        *   For $\frac{3}{4}$: $(60 \div 4) \times 3 = 15 \times 3 = 45$
        *   For $\frac{3}{5}$: $(60 \div 5) \times 3 = 12 \times 3 = 36$
        *   For $\frac{1}{3}$: $(60 \div 3) \times 1 = 20 \times 1 = 20$
    *   *Add New Numerators:* $45 + 36 + 20 = 101$
    *   *Result:* $$\frac{101}{60}$$

2.  *Problem:* $$\frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{5} + \frac{2}{4} = $$
    *   *Denominators:* 3, 5, 4
    *   *Common Denominator:* $3 \times 5 \times 4 = 60$
    *   *New Numerators:*
        *   For $\frac{2}{3}$: $(60 \div 3) \times 2 = 20 \times 2 = 40$

## Topic 22: Addition of Mixed Fractions

This lesson explains a quick method for adding mixed fractions. A mixed fraction is a combination of a whole number (quotient) and a proper fraction (remainder/divisor). For example, in $4 \frac{3}{6}$, $4$ is the quotient, $3$ is the remainder, and $6$ is the divisor.

**Steps to Add Mixed Fractions:**

1.  **Add the whole number parts (quotients):** Sum the whole numbers from each mixed fraction.
2.  **Multiply the denominators:** Find the product of the denominators of the fractional parts. This will be the new common denominator.
3.  **Cross-multiply and add numerators:**
    *   Multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction.
    *   Multiply the numerator of the second fraction by the denominator of the first fraction.
    *   Add these two products. This sum will be the new numerator.
4.  **Simplify if the new numerator is greater than or equal to the new denominator:**
    *   Divide the new numerator by the new denominator.
    *   Add the quotient from this division to the whole number obtained in step 1.
    *   The remainder from this division becomes the new numerator, with the original new denominator (from step 2) staying as the denominator.

**General Format:**

For two mixed fractions $Q_1 \frac{R_1}{D_1} + Q_2 \frac{R_2}{D_2}$:

1.  **Add quotients:** $Q_{total} = Q_1 + Q_2$
2.  **Multiply denominators:** $D_{common} = D_1 \times D_2$
3.  **Cross-multiply and add numerators:** $N_{sum} = (R_1 \times D_2) + (R_2 \times D_1)$
4.  **Form the preliminary result:** $Q_{total} \frac{N_{sum}}{D_{common}}$
5.  **Simplify (if $N_{sum} \ge D_{common}$):**
    *   Divide $N_{sum} \div D_{common}$. Let the quotient be $Q_{fraction}$ and the remainder be $R_{fraction}$.
    *   The final whole number is $Q_{total} + Q_{fraction}$.
    *   The final fractional part is $\frac{R_{fraction}}{D_{common}}$.

**Examples from the Video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Problem:** $4 \frac{3}{6} + 2 \frac{2}{8}$
    *   **Step 1: Add quotients:** $4 + 2 = 6$
    *   **Step 2: Multiply denominators:** $6 \times 8 = 48$
    *   **Step 3: Cross-multiply and add numerators:**
        *   $(3 \times 8) + (2 \times 6) = 24 + 12 = 36$
    *   **Step 4: Form preliminary result:** $6 \frac{36}{48}$
    *   **Step 5: Simplify:** Here, $36 < 48$, so no further division is needed for the whole number part. The fraction $\frac{36}{48}$ can be simplified by dividing both by 12, resulting in $\frac{3}{4}$.
    *   **Final Answer:** $6 \frac{3}{4}$ (The video stops at $6 \frac{36}{48}$ but it's good practice to simplify the fraction).

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Problem:** $5 \frac{1}{5} + 2 \frac{2}{4}$
    *   **Step 1: Add quotients:** $5 + 2 = 7$
    *   **Step 2: Multiply denominators:** $5 \times 4 = 20$
    *   **Step 3: Cross-multiply and add numerators:**
        *   $(1 \times 4) + (2 \times 5) = 4 + 10 = 14$
    *   **Step 4: Form preliminary result:** $7 \frac{14}{20}$
    *   **Step 5: Simplify:** Here, $14 < 20$, so no further division is needed for the whole number part. The fraction $\frac{14}{20}$ can be simplified by dividing both by 2, resulting in $\frac{7}{10}$.
    *   **Final Answer:** $7 \frac{7}{10}$ (The video stops at $7 \frac{14}{20}$ but it's good practice to simplify the fraction).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Problem:** $4 \frac{6}{7} + 5 \frac{3}{5}$
    *   **Step 1: Add quotients:** $4 + 5 = 9$
    *   **Step 2: Multiply denominators:** $7 \times 5 = 35$
    *   **Step 3: Cross-multiply and add numerators:**
        *   $(6 \times 5) + (3 \times 7) = 30 + 21 = 51$
    *   **Step 4: Form preliminary result:** $9 \frac{51}{35}$
    *   **Step 5: Simplify (because $51 \ge 35$):**
        *   Divide $51 \div 35$: $51 = 1 \times 35 + 16$
        *   Quotient ($Q_{fraction}$): $1$
        *   Remainder ($R_{fraction}$): $16$
        *   New whole number: $9 + 1 = 10$
        *   New fractional part: $\frac{16}{35}$
    *   **Final Answer:** $10 \frac{16}{35}$

**Key Points:**

*   This method simplifies the addition of mixed fractions by separating the whole number and fractional parts.
*   Cross-multiplication of the fractional parts efficiently finds a common denominator and combines the numerators.
*   Always remember to simplify the resulting fraction if the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator, and add the resulting whole number to the initial sum of quotients.

## Topic 24: Fraction Multiplication

This lesson explains three ways to multiply fractions:

1.  **Multiplying a fraction by a whole number:**
    *   **Rule:** Multiply the numerator of the fraction by the whole number. The denominator remains unchanged.
    *   **Example 1:** $$ \frac{2}{9} \times 3 = \frac{2 \times 3}{9} = \frac{6}{9} $$
    *   **Example 2:** $$ \frac{9}{8} \times 2 = \frac{9 \times 2}{8} = \frac{18}{8} $$
    *   **Example 3:** $$ \frac{3}{14} \times 8 = \frac{3 \times 8}{14} = \frac{24}{14} $$

2.  **Multiplying two (or more) fractions:**
    *   **Rule:** Multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator. Multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator.
    *   **Example 1:** $$ \frac{3}{9} \times \frac{5}{8} = \frac{3 \times 5}{9 \times 8} = \frac{15}{72} $$
    *   **Example 2:** $$ \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{7} = \frac{3 \times 3}{4 \times 7} = \frac{9}{28} $$
    *   **Example 3:** $$ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1 \times 1}{2 \times 3} = \frac{1}{6} $$

3.  **Multiplying mixed fractions:**
    *   **Rule:** First, convert each mixed fraction into an improper fraction. Then, multiply the improper fractions as described in method 2 (numerator by numerator, denominator by denominator).
    *   **How to convert a mixed fraction to an improper fraction:**
        *   Multiply the whole number part by the denominator.
        *   Add the numerator to the result.
        *   Place this sum over the original denominator.
        *   Example: For $7\frac{1}{2}$, convert to improper fraction as $(7 \times 2) + 1 = 15$, so it becomes $\frac{15}{2}$.
    *   **Example 1:** $$ 7\frac{1}{2} \times 8\frac{5}{9} = \frac{15}{2} \times \frac{77}{9} $$
        *   $15 \times 77 = 1155$
        *   $2 \times 9 = 18$
        *   *Result:* $$ \frac{1155}{18} $$
    *   **Example 2 (shown in video, not fully solved):** $$ 6\frac{1}{6} \times 5\frac{2}{4} $$
        *   Convert $6\frac{1}{6}$ to improper fraction: $(6 \times 6) + 1 = 37$, so $\frac{37}{6}$.
        *   Convert $5\frac{2}{4}$ to improper fraction: $(5 \times 4) + 2 = 22$, so $\frac{22}{4}$.
        *   Multiply the improper fractions: $$ \frac{37}{6} \times \frac{22}{4} = \frac{37 \times 22}{6 \times 4} = \frac{814}{24} $$

*Key Takeaways:*

*   Fractions consist of a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).
*   When multiplying a fraction by a whole number, only the numerator is multiplied.
*   When multiplying two fractions, multiply numerators together and denominators together.
*   When multiplying mixed fractions, convert them to improper fractions first, then multiply.

## Topic 25: Decimal Multiplication

This explanation focuses on multiplying decimal numbers, providing a simple method to handle the decimal point.

**How it works:**

1.  **Ignore the decimal points:** When multiplying numbers with decimals, first treat them as whole numbers and perform the multiplication as usual, ignoring all decimal points.

2.  **Count total decimal places:** After multiplying, count the total number of decimal places in *both* original numbers being multiplied. A decimal place is the number of digits after the decimal point.

3.  **Place the decimal point in the product:** Starting from the rightmost digit of your product (the result from step 1), count left the total number of decimal places you found in step 2. Place the decimal point there. If you run out of digits, add leading zeros until you have enough places.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Problem:** $90 \times 0.8$
    *   **Step 1 (Ignore decimals and multiply):** $90 \times 8 = 720$
    *   **Step 2 (Count decimal places):**
        *   $90$: 0 decimal places (the blue dot in the video implies the point is after 0, making it a whole number).
        *   $0.8$: 1 decimal place (the digit '8').
        *   Total decimal places: $0 + 1 = 1$
    *   **Step 3 (Place decimal point):** In '720', count 1 place from the right.
    *   **Result:** $72.0$ (or simply $72$)

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Problem:** $2.3 \times 0.2$ (The video initially shows $23 \times 0.2$, but then clarifies it as $2.3 \times 0.2$ by adding a point in the number 23).
    *   **Step 1 (Ignore decimals and multiply):** $23 \times 2 = 46$
    *   **Step 2 (Count decimal places):**
        *   $2.3$: 1 decimal place (the digit '3').
        *   $0.2$: 1 decimal place (the digit '2').
        *   Total decimal places: $1 + 1 = 2$
    *   **Step 3 (Place decimal point):** In '46', count 2 places from the right.
    *   **Result:** $0.46$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Problem:** $0.35 \times 0.07$ (The video initially shows $35 \times 0.07$, but then clarifies it as $0.35 \times 0.07$ by adding a point in the number 35).
    *   **Step 1 (Ignore decimals and multiply):** $35 \times 7 = 245$
    *   **Step 2 (Count decimal places):**
        *   $0.35$: 2 decimal places (digits '3', '5').
        *   $0.07$: 2 decimal places (digits '0', '7').
        *   Total decimal places: $2 + 2 = 4$
    *   **Step 3 (Place decimal point):** In '245', count 4 places from the right. Since there are only 3 digits, add one leading zero.
    *   **Result:** $0.0245$

**Key Points:**

*   The process simplifies complex decimal multiplication into basic whole number multiplication followed by precise decimal point placement.
*   Counting decimal places must be done carefully, from right to left in the product.
*   Adding leading zeros to the product is crucial if the number of digits in the product is less than the total decimal places required.


## Topic 26: Decimal Division Trick

This trick simplifies decimal division problems by first removing the decimal points and then re-inserting them into the final answer.

*How it works:*

1.  *Remove decimal points:* Treat the numbers as whole numbers by ignoring the decimal points during the initial division.
    *   Example 1: For $10.42 \div 0.2$, treat as $1042 \div 2$.
    *   Example 2: For $12.24 \div 0.04$, treat as $1224 \div 4$.
    *   Example 3: For $11.22 \div 1.1$, treat as $1122 \div 11$.

2.  *Perform whole number division:* Divide the numbers as if they were integers.
    *   Example 1: $1042 \div 2 = 521$.
    *   Example 2: $1224 \div 4 = 306$.
    *   Example 3: $1122 \div 11 = 102$.

3.  *Determine decimal point placement in the answer:*
    *   *Count decimal places:* Count the number of decimal places in the numerator (N) and the denominator (D) of the original problem.
    *   *Compare counts:*
        *   **If the numerator has more decimal places than the denominator (N > D):** Subtract the number of decimal places in the denominator from the numerator ($N - D$). Place the decimal point in the final answer that many places from the right.
            *   Example 1: Numerator ($10.42$) has 2 decimal places. Denominator ($0.2$) has 1 decimal place. $N - D = 2 - 1 = 1$. So, place the decimal point 1 place from the right in $521$, resulting in $52.1$.
            *   Example 3: Numerator ($11.22$) has 2 decimal places. Denominator ($1.1$) has 1 decimal place. $N - D = 2 - 1 = 1$. So, place the decimal point 1 place from the right in $102$, resulting in $10.2$.
        *   **If the number of decimal places is the same in the numerator and denominator (N = D):** The final answer will be a whole number (no decimal point or effectively a decimal point at the end).
            *   Example 2: Numerator ($12.24$) has 2 decimal places. Denominator ($0.04$) has 2 decimal places. $N - D = 2 - 2 = 0$. So, no decimal point in $306$.
        *   **If the denominator has more decimal places than the numerator (D > N):** Subtract the number of decimal places in the numerator from the denominator ($D - N$). Add that many zeros to the end of your whole number answer. (This scenario is not explicitly shown in the examples but is implied by the rule.)
            *   *Conceptual Example:* If $0.2 \div 0.004$. Numerator ($0.2$) has 1 decimal place. Denominator ($0.004$) has 3 decimal places. $D - N = 3 - 1 = 2$. After dividing $2 \div 4 = 0.5$, if it were $200 \div 4 = 50$, you would add two zeros to $50$ to get $5000$. (This rule can be slightly more complex, but the video emphasizes the N>D and N=D cases).

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $10.42 \div 0.2 =$
    *   Whole number division: $1042 \div 2 = 521$
    *   Decimal places: Numerator (10.42) has 2 places. Denominator (0.2) has 1 place.
    *   Difference: $2 - 1 = 1$. Since N > D, place 1 decimal point from the right.
    *   *Result:* $52.1$

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $12.24 \div 0.04 =$
    *   Whole number division: $1224 \div 4 = 306$
    *   Decimal places: Numerator (12.24) has 2 places. Denominator (0.04) has 2 places.
    *   Difference: $2 - 2 = 0$. Since N = D, no decimal point in the answer.
    *   *Result:* $306$

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $11.22 \div 1.1 =$
    *   Whole number division: $1122 \div 11 = 102$
    *   Decimal places: Numerator (11.22) has 2 places. Denominator (1.1) has 1 place.
    *   Difference: $2 - 1 = 1$. Since N > D, place 1 decimal point from the right.
    *   *Result:* $10.2$

*Key Points:*

*   This method simplifies decimal division by separating the division process from decimal point placement.
*   The primary focus is on comparing the number of decimal places in the numerator and denominator.
*   Practice is essential to master this technique for quickly solving decimal division problems.



## Topic 27: Percentage Tricks

This video presents several tricks for calculating percentages, ranging from basic calculations to application-based problems.

### Basic Percentage Calculation (with trailing zeros)

This trick is used when calculating the percentage of a number, and both the percentage value and the number itself end with zero.

*How it works:*

1.  *Identify the numbers:* Take the two numbers involved in the percentage calculation.
    *   Example 1: 30% of 50
    *   Example 2: 50% of 70
    *   Example 3: 70% of 90

2.  *Cancel the zeros:* Mentally remove one zero from each of the two numbers. This is equivalent to dividing by 10 twice, which is the same as dividing by 100 (which is what percentage calculations inherently involve).
    *   Example 1: 3 and 5
    *   Example 2: 5 and 7
    *   Example 3: 7 and 9

3.  *Multiply the remaining digits:* Multiply the non-zero digits that remain after canceling the zeros.
    *   Example 1: $3 \times 5 = 15$
    *   Example 2: $5 \times 7 = 35$
    *   Example 3: $7 \times 9 = 63$

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **1. 30% of 50**
    *   $3 \times 5 = 15$
*   **2. 50% of 70**
    *   $5 \times 7 = 35$
*   **3. 70% of 90**
    *   $7 \times 9 = 63$

### Percentage Calculation (Approximation and Adjustment)

This trick is useful for calculating percentages of numbers that are close to multiples of ten, allowing for an approximation and then an adjustment.

*How it works:*

1.  *Round the percentage to the nearest multiple of 10:* Identify the percentage value and round it to the nearest multiple of 10 (e.g., 19% becomes 20%, 47% becomes 50%).
    *   Example 1: 19% of 47 becomes 20% of 47.
    *   Example 2: 47% of 12 becomes 50% of 12.

2.  *Calculate the rounded percentage:* Perform the percentage calculation using the rounded value.
    *   Example 1 (20% of 47): Multiply 47 by 2 (which is 94), then place a decimal one spot from the right (because 20% is 2/10, or 0.2). So, $47 \times 2 = 94 \rightarrow 9.4$.
    *   Example 2 (50% of 12): Multiply 12 by 5 (which is 60), then place a decimal one spot from the right. So, $12 \times 5 = 60 \rightarrow 6.0$.

3.  *Determine the difference in percentage:* Find the difference between the original percentage and the rounded percentage. This is the "additional" percentage that was added (or subtracted) for rounding.
    *   Example 1: 20% (rounded) - 19% (original) = 1% additional.
    *   Example 2: 50% (rounded) - 47% (original) = 3% additional.

4.  *Calculate the percentage of the "additional" percentage:* Multiply the original number by the "additional" percentage. Then, place the decimal two spots from the right (since it's a percentage, meaning divided by 100).
    *   Example 1 (1% of 47): $1 \times 47 = 47 \rightarrow 0.47$.
    *   Example 2 (3% of 12): $3 \times 12 = 36 \rightarrow 0.36$.

5.  *Adjust the rounded result:* If the percentage was rounded *up* (i.e., you added to the original percentage), subtract the "additional" percentage value from the rounded result. If the percentage was rounded *down*, you would add it.
    *   Example 1: $9.4 - 0.47 = 8.93$
    *   Example 2: $6.0 - 0.36 = 5.64$

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **4. 19% of 47**
    *   Rounded to 20% of 47: $47 \times 0.2 = 9.4$
    *   Difference: 1% of 47 = 0.47
    *   Result: $9.4 - 0.47 = 8.93$
*   **5. 47% of 12**
    *   Rounded to 50% of 12: $12 \times 0.5 = 6.0$
    *   Difference: 3% of 12 = 0.36
    *   Result: $6.0 - 0.36 = 5.64$

### Application-Based Percentage Problems

These tricks address common word problems involving percentages, such as finding a total amount given a percentage of savings or calculating percentage changes.

#### Type 1: Finding the total amount from a percentage of savings/remaining

This trick is for problems where a portion (percentage) of an amount is spent/used, and the remaining amount (value) is given. The goal is to find the total original amount.

*How it works:*

1.  *Determine the remaining percentage:* Subtract the spent percentage from 100% to find the percentage of the amount remaining.
    *   Example: Ajay spends 40% of his salary. Remaining percentage = $100\% - 40\% = 60\%$.

2.  *Set up the equation:* The given saved amount (value) corresponds to the remaining percentage. So, $Remaining\ Value / Remaining\ Percentage \times 100\%$.
    *   Example: Saved amount is Rs. 480. So, $480 / 60 \times 100$.

3.  *Calculate the total amount:* Perform the calculation.
    *   Example: $480 / 60 = 8$. Then, $8 \times 100 = 800$.

*Example from the video (with solution):*

*   **1. Ajay spends 40% of his salary and saves Rs. 480 per month. Find his monthly salary.**
    *   Spent percentage = 40%
    *   Remaining percentage = $100\% - 40\% = 60\%$
    *   Saved amount = Rs. 480
    *   Monthly salary = $(480 / 60) \times 100 = 8 \times 100 = 800$
    *   *Result:* Rs. 800

#### Type 2: Percentage Change (Increase and Decrease)

This trick is for problems where a quantity changes by a certain percentage, and you need to find the percentage change required to return to the original state or to compare it to another quantity.

*How it works:*

1.  *Identify the percentage change (R):* Note the given percentage increase or decrease. Let this be 'R'.
    *   Example 1: Sugar price increased by 10%. So, R = 10.
    *   Example 2: A's income is 40% more than B's. So, R = 40.

2.  *Apply the formula based on increase/decrease:*
    *   **If there is an increase (more):** The formula is $\frac{R}{100 + R} \times 100$.
        *   This formula calculates the percentage decrease needed to offset an initial increase.
    *   **If there is a decrease (less):** The formula is $\frac{R}{100 - R} \times 100$.
        *   This formula calculates the percentage increase needed to offset an initial decrease.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **2. If the price of sugar is increased by 10%, then by how much percent consumption should be reduced so that the expenditure remains the same?**
    *   Percentage increase (R) = 10%
    *   Since it's an *increase* and we want to find the *reduction*, use the formula $\frac{R}{100 + R} \times 100$.
    *   Consumption reduction = $\frac{10}{100 + 10} \times 100 = \frac{10}{110} \times 100 = \frac{100}{11}\%$
    *   *Result:* $\frac{100}{11}\%$

*   **3. If A's income is 40% more than the income of B, then what percentage of B's income is less than income of A?**
    *   Percentage more (R) = 40%
    *   Since A's income is *more* and we want to find how much B's income is *less*, use the formula $\frac{R}{100 + R} \times 100$.
    *   Percentage less = $\frac{40}{100 + 40} \times 100 = \frac{40}{140} \times 100 = \frac{4}{14} \times 100 = \frac{2}{7} \times 100 = \frac{200}{7}\%$
    *   *Result:* $\frac{200}{7}\%$

*Key Points for Application Problems:*

*   Always identify whether the problem deals with a "remaining portion" or a "percentage change" scenario.
*   For "remaining portion" problems, work with the complementary percentage (100% minus the given percentage).
*   For "percentage change" problems, pay close attention to whether the initial change is an increase or a decrease, as this determines which formula to use for the denominator ($100+R$ or $100-R$).
*   Consistent practice with different types of percentage problems is crucial for mastering these tricks.



**VEDIC MATHEMATICS**

## Topic 28: Adyamadyenantya Mantyena (Multiplication of Mixed Feet and Inches)

This Vedic trick, "Adyamadyenantya Mantyena," provides a method for multiplying measurements given in feet and inches, particularly useful for calculating the area of a rectangular piece of land.

*How it works:*

The core idea is to convert the mixed feet and inches measurements into an algebraic expression and then apply algebraic multiplication, relating the terms back to square feet and square inches.

*Conversion Steps:*

1.  **Represent feet as an algebraic variable:** Let 1 foot be represented by a variable, say 'x'. Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can consider 'x' to be equivalent to 12 when we do the final conversion.

2.  **Convert mixed measurements to algebraic expressions:**
    *   A measurement like "A feet B inches" is expressed as `Ax + B`.
    *   Example: 7' 8" becomes `7x + 8`.
    *   Example: 5' 11" becomes `5x + 11`.

3.  **Perform algebraic multiplication (using Urdhva Tiryagbhyam or cross-multiplication method):**
    *   Multiply the two algebraic expressions. For example, `(Ax + B) * (Cx + D)`.
    *   The result will be in the form `ACx^2 + (AD + BC)x + BD`.
    *   Example 1: `(7x + 8) * (5x + 11)`
        *   `7x * 5x = 35x^2` (Multiply the first terms)
        *   Cross-multiply and add: `(7x * 11) + (8 * 5x) = 77x + 40x = 117x`
        *   `8 * 11 = 88` (Multiply the last terms)
        *   Result: `35x^2 + 117x + 88`

4.  **Substitute `x = 12` and `x^2 = 144` for unit conversion:**
    *   Recall that `x` represents 1 foot (12 inches). Therefore, `x^2` represents 1 square foot ($12 \times 12 = 144$ square inches).
    *   The term with `x^2` directly gives the square feet.
    *   The term with `x` (which represents feet-inches) needs to be converted. Divide the coefficient by 12. The quotient will be added to the square feet part, and the remainder will be inches.
    *   The constant term (which represents square inches) needs to be converted. Divide the constant by 144. The quotient will be added to the square feet part, and the remainder will be square inches.

*Steps for the video's method:*

The video simplifies step 4 by performing a carry-over division as follows:

1.  **Perform algebraic multiplication:** Get the result in the form `P x^2 + Q x + R`.
    *   The `P` term directly contributes to square feet.
    *   The `Q` term (representing feet-inches) is handled next.
    *   The `R` term (representing square inches) is handled last.

2.  **Convert the `Qx` term:**
    *   Divide `Q` by 12. Let the quotient be `Q_q` and the remainder be `Q_r`.
    *   Add `Q_q` to `P`. So, `P_new = P + Q_q`.
    *   The remainder `Q_r` is retained as an 'inch' value for the intermediate calculation.

3.  **Convert the `R` term (square inches):**
    *   This step is slightly different from a direct substitution of `x^2 = 144` and `x = 12`. The video uses a specific carry-over approach.
    *   After the algebraic multiplication, the expression is `P x^2 + Q x + R`.
    *   `P` (coefficient of `x^2`) represents initial square feet.
    *   `Q` (coefficient of `x`) represents initial feet-inches.
    *   `R` (constant term) represents initial square inches.

    The video's carry-over approach:
    *   Start with `P x^2`.
    *   Then, divide `Q` by 12. Let quotient be `q_Q` and remainder `r_Q`.
    *   The new square feet value becomes `P + q_Q`.
    *   The `r_Q` becomes part of the inches.
    *   Add `r_Q` (from the `Qx` term) to `R` (the constant term). Let this sum be `R_new = Q_r + R`.
    *   Now, `R_new` represents the total inches (potentially more than 12).
    *   Divide `R_new` by 12. Let quotient be `q_R` and remainder `r_R`.
    *   Add `q_R` to the square feet. So, `Final_SqFt = P_new + q_R`.
    *   The remainder `r_R` becomes the final inches.

    However, the video implicitly states that 1 foot = 12 inches, leading to 1 square foot = 144 square inches. The method presented by the speaker is actually a specific interpretation of the algebraic multiplication where:
    *   The `x^2` term directly represents square feet.
    *   The `x` term represents feet-inches.
    *   The constant term represents square inches.

    So, the algebraic result `P x^2 + Q x + R` is interpreted as `P Sq.ft + Q ft.in + R Sq.in`.
    *   The term `P` is directly taken as the square feet part.
    *   The term `Q` is treated as a sum of feet and inches. Since each 'foot' in `Qx` is 12 inches, `Qx` should be interpreted as `Q * 12` inches.
    *   The term `R` is square inches.

    This interpretation leads to a slightly different final conversion logic than a direct algebraic substitution if `x` is explicitly 12 inches.

    Let's re-interpret the video's presentation for clarity:
    The method transforms algebraic product `35x^2 + 117x + 88` into a mixed units format (sq ft, inches).

    1.  The coefficient of `x^2` (`P`) becomes the initial square feet.
        `P = 35` sq.ft.
    2.  The coefficient of `x` (`Q`) is divided by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).
        `Q = 117`. $117 = 9 \times 12 + 9$. So, `q_Q = 9` (feet) and `r_Q = 9` (inches).
        The `q_Q` (9 feet) is added to the initial square feet.
        `35 + 9 = 44` sq.ft.
        The `r_Q` (9 inches) is carried over.
    3.  The constant term (`R`) is added to the remainder `r_Q`.
        `R = 88`. `R_total_inches = 88 + 9 = 97` inches.
    4.  The `R_total_inches` (97 inches) needs to be converted into square inches. Since 1 sq.ft = 144 sq.in, this conversion is not directly $97/12$.
        The video implies that `x^2` is square feet, `x` is linear feet (to be converted to inches for a mixed unit calculation), and the constant is inches. This interpretation is somewhat inconsistent with standard algebraic unit conversions.

    **Correct Interpretation based on standard unit conversion (as commonly done with `ft-inch` calculations):**

    If length is `L = A ft B in = (A * 12 + B) inches`
    And breadth is `W = C ft D in = (C * 12 + D) inches`
    Area `A = L * W` square inches.
    Then convert `A` square inches to `P` sq ft `Q` sq inches by dividing by 144.

    The Vedic method shown is a different way:
    Length `L = (Ax + B)` and Breadth `W = (Cx + D)` where `x = 1 foot`.
    Area `A = (Ax + B)(Cx + D) = ACx^2 + (AD+BC)x + BD`.

    Now, substitute `x = 1 ft`.
    `x^2 = 1 sq ft`.
    `x = 1 ft`.

    The terms are:
    `AC` sq ft.
    `(AD+BC)` ft-inches.
    `BD` sq inches.

    The conversion then proceeds:
    1.  `AC` is the primary square feet.
    2.  `(AD+BC)` is the number of "linear" units (feet) that were effectively multiplied by inches. To convert this to square inches, multiply by 12.
    3.  `BD` is already in square inches.

    This leads to:
    `Total Area = AC` (sq ft) `+ (AD+BC)` (ft-in) `+ BD` (sq in)

    To get the final area in `Sq.ft - Sq.in` format:
    `BD` (sq in) -> divide by 144 to get `q_BD` (sq ft) and `r_BD` (sq in).
    `q_BD` is added to `AC`.
    `r_BD` is the final sq inches.

    Then, `(AD+BC)` (ft-in). This term usually refers to the linear dimension. For example, if we have `117 ft-in`, it means 117 units where each unit is 1 foot * 1 inch. This is effectively 117 sq inches.
    So, `(AD+BC)` (sq in) -> divide by 144 to get `q_(AD+BC)` (sq ft) and `r_(AD+BC)` (sq in).
    `q_(AD+BC)` is added to `AC`.
    `r_(AD+BC)` is added to `r_BD`.

    The video's actual computation is:
    `P x^2 + (Q/12) (12x) + R`
    Here `x` is feet. `12` is inches.
    `P` is sq.ft.
    `Q` is a mixed unit (foot-inch)
    `R` is sq.inches.

    The method is (let's use the numerical example from the video to match):
    `L = 7' 8"` and `W = 5' 11"`

    4.  **Product of feet parts:** $7 \times 5 = 35$ (This is $P$ in $Px^2$). This is 35 sq.ft.
    5.  **Cross products and sum of inches:** $(7 \times 11) + (5 \times 8) = 77 + 40 = 117$ (This is $Q$ in $Qx$). This is 117 feet-inches, which means 117 units of (1 foot * 1 inch) or 117 square inches.
    6.  **Product of inches parts:** $8 \times 11 = 88$ (This is $R$). This is 88 square inches.

    So, the direct result from algebraic multiplication (interpreting `x` as feet and `1` as inches) is:
    `35 Sq.ft + 117 (Sq.inches equivalent of ft-in) + 88 (Sq.inches)`

    Now combine the inch parts and convert to sq.ft:
    Total Square Inches = $117 + 88 = 205$ Sq.in.

    Convert 205 Sq.in to Sq.ft and remaining Sq.in:
    1 Sq.ft = 144 Sq.in.
    $205 \div 144 = 1$ (quotient) with $61$ (remainder).
    So, 205 Sq.in = 1 Sq.ft and 61 Sq.in.

    Add this 1 Sq.ft to the 35 Sq.ft from step 1:
    Total Area = $35 + 1 = 36$ Sq.ft and $61$ Sq.in.

    **The video's actual calculation process is as follows:**

    Length: 7' 8"
    Breadth: 5' 11"

    Algebraic representation: `(7x + 8)` and `(5x + 11)` where `x = 12` inches (1 foot).

    **Step 1: Multiply the "feet" parts.**
    $7 \times 5 = 35$. This forms the `P` coefficient for `x^2` or `feet^2`.
    `35x^2`

    **Step 2: Cross-multiply and sum the mixed parts.**
    $(7 \times 11) + (8 \times 5) = 77 + 40 = 117$. This forms the `Q` coefficient for `x` or `feet-inches`.
    `117x`

    **Step 3: Multiply the "inches" parts.**
    $8 \times 11 = 88$. This forms the `R` constant or `inches^2`.
    `88`

    The initial algebraic result is `35x^2 + 117x + 88`.

    Now, convert this to feet and inches:
    *   **Convert the middle term (117x):**
        Since `x = 12` inches, `117x` represents `117 feet-inches`. Each `12 feet-inches` makes 1 square foot.
        Divide 117 by 12:
        $117 \div 12 = 9$ (quotient) with $9$ (remainder).
        This means 9 square feet and 9 feet-inches (which is 9 inches when added to other inches).
        So, add 9 to the 35 square feet: $35 + 9 = 44$ square feet.
        The remainder 9 becomes 9 "single inches" for accumulation.

    *   **Convert the last term (88):**
        This is 88 square inches.
        Now, combine the 9 inches (from the previous step's remainder) with the 88.
        $88 + 9 = 97$. This is not 97 inches, it's 97 square inches.

    This is where the video's explanation becomes somewhat inconsistent or uses a different interpretation of units.
    The video writes `35x^2 + (9x12 + 9)x + 88`.
    Then it says `44x^2 + 196`. This step is crucial and where the speaker deviates from standard algebraic unit conversion.

    Let's re-examine exactly what the speaker writes:
    `35x^2 + 117x + 88`
    Then, it represents `117x` as `(9 * 12 + 9)`. Here, 'x' is treated as feet, and the '9 * 12' means 9 feet * 12 inches (or 9 square feet) and '+ 9' means 9 "remainder" (inches). This step assumes `x=1` (for algebraic multiplication) and then substitutes `x=12` (for units) in the process.

    `35x^2 + (9 * 12 + 9) + 88` (where `12` acts as `x`)
    This implies: `35x^2 + (9x + 9) + 88`. This makes no sense.

    **The actual interpretation of "Adyamadyenantya Mantyena" for area of `A ft B in` by `C ft D in` is:**

    1.  **Feet * Feet (P):** `A * C` square feet.
    2.  **Feet * Inches (Q):** `(A * D) + (C * B)` feet-inches. This means `Q` linear feet multiplied by 1 inch. So, `Q` sq.inches.
    3.  **Inches * Inches (R):** `B * D` square inches.

    **Total Area = `AC` Sq.ft + `QD` Sq.in + `BD` Sq.in**

    Now, convert all square inches to square feet and remaining square inches:
    `Total Sq.in = QD + BD`
    `Total Sq.in = (QD + BD) / 144` gives `X` Sq.ft and `Y` Sq.in.

    `Final Area = (AC + X)` Sq.ft `Y` Sq.in.

    Let's apply this consistent method to the video's first example:
    Length = 7' 8"
    Breadth = 5' 11"

    4.  `A * C = 7 * 5 = 35` Sq.ft.
    5.  `Q = (A * D) + (C * B) = (7 * 11) + (5 * 8) = 77 + 40 = 117` Sq.in.
    6.  `R = B * D = 8 * 11 = 88` Sq.in.

    Total Area = `35` Sq.ft `+ 117` Sq.in `+ 88` Sq.in.
    Combine square inches: $117 + 88 = 205$ Sq.in.

    Convert 205 Sq.in to Sq.ft and Sq.in:
    $205 \div 144 = 1$ (quotient) with $61$ (remainder).
    So, 205 Sq.in = 1 Sq.ft and 61 Sq.in.

    Add this 1 Sq.ft to the `35` Sq.ft:
    `Final Area = (35 + 1)` Sq.ft `61` Sq.in = `36` Sq.ft `61` Sq.in.

    The speaker's answer is `45 Sq.ft 52 inch`. This is different.

    Let's try to follow the speaker's exact steps and notation to understand their derivation, despite potential inconsistencies.

*Steps as shown in the video for the first example:*

**Problem 1:** Rectangular piece of land whose length and breadth are 7' 8" and 5' 11" respectively. Find the area of the land.

1.  **Represent as algebraic expressions:**
    Length: $7x + 8$
    Breadth: $5x + 11$
    (Here, `x` is 1 foot = 12 inches)

2.  **Multiply algebraically (Urdhva Tiryagbhyam):**
    $(7x + 8) \times (5x + 11) = (7 \times 5)x^2 + ((7 \times 11) + (8 \times 5))x + (8 \times 11)$
    $= 35x^2 + (77 + 40)x + 88$
    $= 35x^2 + 117x + 88$

3.  **Convert `117x` term (feet-inches to square feet and remaining inches):**
    The video effectively treats `117x` as `117 inches`, not `117 feet-inches`. This is the crucial deviation.
    The speaker shows a division of `117` by `12`: $117 = (9 \times 12) + 9$.
    The quotient `9` is added to the `35x^2` term (effectively as square feet).
    So, $35 + 9 = 44$. This becomes the new `x^2` coefficient (square feet).
    The remainder `9` is carried over as an "inch" (represented as `9` in `(9 \times 12 + 9)` on the right side of the screen).

4.  **Combine the remaining inches with the constant term and convert to square inches:**
    The original constant term was `88`. The remainder from the previous step was `9` (inches).
    The speaker adds these two: `88 + 9 = 97`. This `97` is then treated as the total "square inches".
    The speaker then writes `44x^2 + 196`. This `196` comes from `(9 * 12 + 9) + 88`, if `x` is interpreted as 12 inches where `9*12` is the square feet equivalent. This makes the `196` value confusing.

    Let's re-watch the point where `117x` is converted in the video (01:46).
    The speaker writes: `35x^2 + (9 * 12 + 9) + 88`.
    He then explains that `9` (from `9*12`) is added to `35` to get `44`.
    And then adds `(9*12) + 9 + 88 = 108 + 9 + 88 = 205`.
    This `205` is divided by `144` (which is $12^2$) to get `1` (quotient) and `61` (remainder).
    So, `44` (from $35+9$) gets `+1` (from $205/144$) to become `45` sq.ft.
    The remainder `61` is the inches.
    **So the result is `45 Sq.ft 61 Inches`.**
    The speaker's handwritten result `45 Sq.ft 52 inch` (at 02:29) and `44x^2 + 196` (at 02:12) is inconsistent with his own division calculation of `196/144` yielding `1` and `52`.
    Let's check `196 / 144 = 1` remainder `52`. This is correct.
    Where did `196` come from?
    If the `117x` term becomes `117 * 12 = 1404` square inches.
    And `88` is `88` square inches.
    Total inches = $1404 + 88 = 1492$ sq. inches.
    $1492 / 144 = 10$ (quotient) and $52$ (remainder).
    So, $35$ sq.ft $+ 10$ sq.ft $= 45$ sq.ft and $52$ sq.in.
    **This matches the speaker's final result!**

    So, the speaker's method for converting `P x^2 + Q x + R` into Square Feet and Square Inches is:
    *   The `P` term directly contributes to square feet.
    *   The `Q` term (coefficient of `x`) is multiplied by 12 (since `x=12` inches, `Qx` would be `Q * 12` square inches).
    *   The `R` term (constant) is already in square inches.
    *   Add `Q * 12 + R` to get total square inches.
    *   Divide this total square inches by 144 to get additional square feet (`q_sqft`) and remaining square inches (`r_sqin`).
    *   The final area is `(P + q_sqft)` square feet and `r_sqin` square inches.

    This is a correct conversion method, but the verbal explanation and intermediate writing on the screen were a bit confusing.

*Final Steps from the video, re-interpreted correctly:*

**Problem 1:** Rectangular piece of land whose length and breadth are 7' 8" and 5' 11" respectively. Find the area of the land.

1.  **Algebraic multiplication:**
    $(7x + 8) \times (5x + 11) = 35x^2 + 117x + 88$

2.  **Convert to Square Feet and Square Inches:**
    *   `35x^2`: Interpreted as 35 square feet.
    *   `117x`: Interpreted as $117 \times 12$ square inches $= 1404$ square inches.
    *   `88`: Interpreted as 88 square inches.

    Total Square Inches = $1404 + 88 = 1492$ square inches.

    Convert total square inches to square feet and remaining square inches:
    $1492 \div 144 = 10$ (quotient) and $52$ (remainder).
    This means 10 square feet and 52 square inches.

    Add these 10 square feet to the initial 35 square feet:
    $35 + 10 = 45$ square feet.

    **Final Answer:** 45 Sq.ft 52 inches.

---

**Problem 2:** Rectangular piece of land whose length and breadth are 3' 7" and 5' 10" respectively. Find the area of the land.

1.  **Represent as algebraic expressions:**
    Length: $3x + 7$
    Breadth: $5x + 10$
    (Here, `x` is 1 foot = 12 inches)

2.  **Multiply algebraically (Urdhva Tiryagbhyam):**
    $(3x + 7) \times (5x + 10) = (3 \times 5)x^2 + ((3 \times 10) + (7 \times 5))x + (7 \times 10)$
    $= 15x^2 + (30 + 35)x + 70$
    $= 15x^2 + 65x + 70$

3.  **Convert to Square Feet and Square Inches:**
    *   `15x^2`: Interpreted as 15 square feet.
    *   `65x`: Interpreted as $65 \times 12$ square inches $= 780$ square inches.
    *   `70`: Interpreted as 70 square inches.

    Total Square Inches = $780 + 70 = 850$ square inches.

    Convert total square inches to square feet and remaining square inches:
    $850 \div 144 = 5$ (quotient) and $130$ (remainder).
    This means 5 square feet and 130 square inches.

    Add these 5 square feet to the initial 15 square feet:
    $15 + 5 = 20$ square feet.

    **Final Answer:** 20 Sq.ft 130 Sq.in.

*Key Points of the "Adyamadyenantya Mantyena" for Feet and Inches:*

*   This method leverages the concept of treating feet as an algebraic variable `x` (where `x = 12` inches).
*   The multiplication follows standard algebraic rules, resulting in terms `Px^2`, `Qx`, and `R`.
*   The conversion to final units (square feet and square inches) involves:
    *   The `P` coefficient directly gives a part of the total square feet.
    *   The `Q` coefficient is multiplied by 12 (to convert feet-inches to square inches).
    *   The `R` constant is already in square inches.
    *   Sum the `Q*12` and `R` terms to get total square inches.
    *   Divide this total by 144 (since 1 sq.ft = 144 sq.in) to get additional square feet and the final remaining square inches.
    *   Add the additional square feet to the `P` coefficient to get the total square feet.
*   This trick simplifies the calculation for mixed units without needing to convert everything to a single unit (e.g., all inches) at the start.

##  Topic 29: ANURUPE - SUNYAMANYAT 

This Vedic Maths trick is used to solve systems of linear equations in two variables quickly, especially when certain ratios are present.

**The Sutra (Rule):**
"If one is in ratio, the other one is zero."

This means if the coefficients of one variable (or the constant terms) in the two linear equations are in a specific ratio, then the other variable can be set to zero to find the solution.

**How it works (Step-by-step):**

1.  **Identify the Equations:** You are given two linear equations in two variables, typically of the form:
    *   $a_1x + b_1y = c_1$
    *   $a_2x + b_2y = c_2$

2.  **Calculate Ratios:**
    *   **Ratio of x coefficients:** $R_x = a_1 : a_2$
    *   **Ratio of y coefficients:** $R_y = b_1 : b_2$
    *   **Ratio of constant terms:** $R_c = c_1 : c_2$

3.  **Check for Matching Ratios:**
    *   If $R_x = R_c$, then $y = 0$.
    *   If $R_y = R_c$, then $x = 0$.

4.  **Solve for the Non-Zero Variable:** Once one variable is set to zero, substitute this value into *either* of the original equations (or any simplified form derived from the ratios) to find the value of the other variable.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Equations:**
        *   $3x + 7y = 2$
        *   $4x + 21y = 6$

    *   **Step 2: Calculate Ratios:**
        *   $R_x = 3 : 4$
        *   $R_y = 7 : 21 \implies 1 : 3$ (dividing both by 7)
        *   $R_c = 2 : 6 \implies 1 : 3$ (dividing both by 2)

    *   **Step 3: Check for Matching Ratios:**
        *   We observe that $R_y = R_c$ (both are $1:3$).
        *   Therefore, according to the Sutra, the other variable, $x$, must be zero. So, **$x = 0$**.

    *   **Step 4: Solve for y:**
        *   Substitute $x=0$ into the first equation: $3(0) + 7y = 2 \implies 7y = 2 \implies y = \frac{2}{7}$
        *   (Alternatively, using the second equation: $4(0) + 21y = 6 \implies 21y = 6 \implies y = \frac{6}{21} = \frac{2}{7}$)
        *   **Result:** $x=0, y=\frac{2}{7}$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Equations:**
        *   $323x + 147y = 1615$
        *   $969x + 321y = 4845$

    *   **Step 2: Calculate Ratios:**
        *   $R_x = 323 : 969 \implies 1 : 3$ (since $969 = 323 \times 3$)
        *   $R_y = 147 : 321$ (This ratio does not simplify to $1:3$)
        *   $R_c = 1615 : 4845 \implies 1 : 3$ (since $4845 = 1615 \times 3$)

    *   **Step 3: Check for Matching Ratios:**
        *   We observe that $R_x = R_c$ (both are $1:3$).
        *   Therefore, according to the Sutra, the other variable, $y$, must be zero. So, **$y = 0$**.

    *   **Step 4: Solve for x:**
        *   Substitute $y=0$ into the first equation: $323x + 147(0) = 1615 \implies 323x = 1615 \implies x = \frac{1615}{323}$
        *   $x = 5$
        *   (Alternatively, using the second equation: $969x + 321(0) = 4845 \implies 969x = 4845 \implies x = \frac{4845}{969} = 5$)
        *   **Result:** $x=5, y=0$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is highly efficient for specific types of linear equations where one of the variable coefficient ratios matches the constant term ratio.
*   It significantly reduces the algebraic steps compared to traditional methods (substitution or elimination).
*   The Sutra "If one is in ratio, the other one is zero" refers to the relationship between the coefficient ratios ($a_1:a_2$ or $b_1:b_2$) and the constant ratio ($c_1:c_2$). If $a_1:a_2 = c_1:c_2$, then $y=0$. If $b_1:b_2 = c_1:c_2$, then $x=0$.
*   If *both* $R_x=R_c$ and $R_y=R_c$ (as shown in the second example), it means the equations are dependent or represent the same line, and setting either variable to zero will lead to a valid solution for the other. The video demonstrates this by showing both $x=0$ and $y=0$ cases for clarity, but typically, you'd only need to pick one.
*   This method is particularly useful in competitive exams like UPSC, PSC, Olympiads, and other situations where quick calculation of solutions to linear equations is required.


## Topic 30: Finding Numbers from the Difference of their Squares (Anurupayena Trick)

This Vedic math trick, based on the "Anurupayena" sutra, helps find two numbers when the difference of their squares is given.

*How it works:*

The core idea is to factorize the difference of squares: $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$.
If the difference of two square numbers is given as 'N', then $N = (a - b)(a + b)$.
We look for factors of 'N' such that their average and half-difference yield integers.

*Steps to find the numbers:*

1.  **Identify the given difference (N):** This is the value representing $a^2 - b^2$.

2.  **Find two factors of N:** Find two numbers, say 'X' and 'Y', such that $X \times Y = N$.
    *   It's often helpful to list all factor pairs of N.
    *   The sum of these factors, $X + Y$, should be an even number, and their difference, $X - Y$, should also be an even number. This ensures that when divided by 2, they result in integers.

3.  **Calculate the two numbers:**
    *   **First number (larger):** Add the two factors and divide by 2: $\frac{X + Y}{2}$
    *   **Second number (smaller):** Subtract the two factors and divide by 2: $\frac{X - Y}{2}$

*General Formula (derived from $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$):*

If $N = (a-b)(a+b)$, let $X = (a+b)$ and $Y = (a-b)$.
Then, $a = \frac{X+Y}{2}$ and $b = \frac{X-Y}{2}$.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Problem:** Difference of two square numbers is 9. Find the numbers.
    *   **Given N:** 9
    *   **Factors of 9:** The simplest pair is $9 \times 1$.
        *   Here, $X = 9$ and $Y = 1$. (Both $X+Y = 10$ and $X-Y = 8$ are even).
    *   **First number:** $\frac{9 + 1}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5$
    *   **Second number:** $\frac{9 - 1}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4$
    *   **Result:** The numbers are 5 and 4.
    *   **Check:** $5^2 - 4^2 = 25 - 16 = 9$. (Correct)

*   **Example 2:**
    *   **Problem:** Difference of two square numbers is 48. Find the numbers.
    *   **Given N:** 48
    *   **Factors of 48:**
        *   $8 \times 6 = 48$
        *   $12 \times 4 = 48$
        *   $24 \times 2 = 48$
        *   $48 \times 1 = 48$

    *   **Applying the trick to different factor pairs:**

        *   **Pair 1: (8, 6)**
            *   Sum: $8 + 6 = 14$
            *   Difference: $8 - 6 = 2$
            *   First number: $\frac{14}{2} = 7$
            *   Second number: $\frac{2}{2} = 1$
            *   **Set 1:** (7, 1)
            *   **Check:** $7^2 - 1^2 = 49 - 1 = 48$. (Correct)

        *   **Pair 2: (12, 4)**
            *   Sum: $12 + 4 = 16$
            *   Difference: $12 - 4 = 8$
            *   First number: $\frac{16}{2} = 8$
            *   Second number: $\frac{8}{2} = 4$
            *   **Set 2:** (8, 4)
            *   **Check:** $8^2 - 4^2 = 64 - 16 = 48$. (Correct)

        *   **Pair 3: (24, 2)**
            *   Sum: $24 + 2 = 26$
            *   Difference: $24 - 2 = 22$
            *   First number: $\frac{26}{2} = 13$
            *   Second number: $\frac{22}{2} = 11$
            *   **Set 3:** (13, 11)
            *   **Check:** $13^2 - 11^2 = 169 - 121 = 48$. (Correct)

        *   **Pair 4: (48, 1)**
            *   Sum: $48 + 1 = 49$ (Odd)
            *   Difference: $48 - 1 = 47$ (Odd)
            *   First number: $\frac{49}{2} = 24.5$
            *   Second number: $\frac{47}{2} = 23.5$
            *   **Note:** Since the numbers are generally expected to be integers, this pair would usually be disregarded.

    *   **Result:** For a difference of 48, there are multiple sets of integer numbers: (7, 1), (8, 4), and (13, 11).

*   **Example 3:**
    *   **Problem:** Difference of two square numbers is 13. Find the numbers.
    *   **Given N:** 13
    *   **Factors of 13:** 13 is a prime number, so the only integer factor pair is $13 \times 1$.
        *   Here, $X = 13$ and $Y = 1$.
    *   **First number:** $\frac{13 + 1}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7$
    *   **Second number:** $\frac{13 - 1}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6$
    *   **Result:** The numbers are 7 and 6.
    *   **Check:** $7^2 - 6^2 = 49 - 36 = 13$. (Correct)

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is useful for competitive exams and Olympiads where such problems might appear in various application forms (e.g., areas of squares, algebraic identities).
*   The key is to find factor pairs (X, Y) of the given difference (N) such that both their sum (X+Y) and difference (X-Y) are even. If N is odd, then one factor must be odd and the other must be odd for their sum/difference to be even. If N is even, then both factors must be even for their sum/difference to be even.
*   Practice with various numbers to master this trick.

##  Topic 31: Sunyam Samya Samuchyah - Model 1

This Vedic Math Sutra, "Sunyam Samya Samuchyah," translates to "When the sum is the same, that sum is zero." In algebraic terms, if two expressions are equal and they share a common factor or a common structure, setting that common part to zero can yield the solution for the variable. This trick is particularly useful for solving algebraic equations (like polynomials or linear equations) quickly.

*How it works (Model 1):*

1.  **Identify the common part:** Look for an identical expression or factor on both sides of the equals sign in the algebraic equation.
2.  **Equate the common part to zero:** Set the identified common expression or factor equal to zero.
3.  **Solve for the variable:** Solve the resulting simple equation to find the value of the variable.

*General Formula (for Model 1):*

If an equation is in the form:
$$ A \cdot (x + k) = B \cdot (x + k) $$
where $A$ and $B$ are coefficients (or other expressions not involving $x+k$), and $(x+k)$ is the common factor on both sides.

Then, the solution can be found by setting the common factor to zero:
$$ x + k = 0 $$
$$ x = -k $$

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ 6x + 2x = 4x + 3x $$
    *   *Direct Calculation (traditional method):*
        $$ 8x = 7x $$
        $$ 8x - 7x = 0 $$
        $$ x = 0 $$
    *   *Vedic Math (Sunyam Samya Samuchyah):*
        The instructor notes that $x=0$ is the solution, and this method is useful when zero is the result. This specific example is a simple case where the common factor is 'x' itself. If we rewrite the equation as $x(6+2) = x(4+3)$, then $x(8) = x(7)$. This implies $8x - 7x = 0$, leading to $x=0$.
        *   *Result:* $x = 0$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ 5(x + 1) = 3(x + 1) $$
    *   *Identify common part:* $(x + 1)$ is common on both sides.
    *   *Vedic Math (Sunyam Samya Samuchyah):*
        1.  Set the common factor to zero: $x + 1 = 0$
        2.  Solve for $x$: $x = -1$
    *   *Direct Calculation (traditional method for verification):*
        $$ 5x + 5 = 3x + 3 $$
        $$ 5x - 3x = 3 - 5 $$
        $$ 2x = -2 $$
        $$ x = \frac{-2}{2} $$
        $$ x = -1 $$
    *   *Result:* $x = -1$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ 9x + 9 = 7x + 7 $$
    *   *Rewrite to identify common factor:*
        $$ 9(x + 1) = 7(x + 1) $$
    *   *Identify common part:* $(x + 1)$ is common on both sides.
    *   *Vedic Math (Sunyam Samya Samuchyah):*
        1.  Set the common factor to zero: $x + 1 = 0$
        2.  Solve for $x$: $x = -1$
    *   *Result:* $x = -1$

*Key Points:*
*   This specific model (Model 1) of "Sunyam Samya Samuchyah" applies when there's an identical algebraic expression (like a binomial factor) on both sides of the equation.
*   The identical expression can be a direct factor or can be obtained by factoring out a common number from each side of the equation.
*   Setting this common expression to zero provides a direct and quick solution for the variable, bypassing longer algebraic steps.
*   The video mentions that there are "several meanings under different contexts" and "several models" for this Sutra, indicating that this is just one specific application.


##  Topic 32: Sunyam Samya Samuchyah: Model 2

This method provides a shortcut for solving algebraic equations of the form:
$$ (x+a)(x+b) = (x+c)(x+d) $$
where we need to find the value of 'x'.

*How it works:*

1.  *Identify the constants:* In the given equation, identify the constants 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. Note their signs.
    *   Left side: $(x+a)(x+b)$
    *   Right side: $(x+c)(x+d)$

2.  *Apply the formula for 'x':* The value of 'x' can be directly calculated using the formula:
    $$ x = \frac{cd - ab}{(a+b) - (c+d)} $$

*Example 1 from the video (with solution):*

*   **Problem:** $$(x+3)(x+4) = (x-2)(x-6)$$
*   **Identify Constants:**
    *   $a = 3$
    *   $b = 4$
    *   $c = -2$
    *   $d = -6$
*   **Calculate $cd$:**
    *   $c \times d = (-2) \times (-6) = 12$
*   **Calculate $ab$:**
    *   $a \times b = 3 \times 4 = 12$
*   **Calculate $a+b$:**
    *   $a+b = 3+4 = 7$
*   **Calculate $c+d$:**
    *   $c+d = (-2) + (-6) = -8$
*   **Apply the formula:**
    $$ x = \frac{12 - 12}{7 - (-8)} $$
    $$ x = \frac{0}{7 + 8} $$
    $$ x = \frac{0}{15} $$
    $$ x = 0 $$
*   **Result:** $x = 0$

*Example 2 from the video (with solution):*

*   **Problem:** $$(x-6)(x+7) = (x+3)(x-11)$$
*   **Identify Constants:**
    *   $a = -6$
    *   $b = 7$
    *   $c = 3$
    *   $d = -11$
*   **Calculate $cd$:**
    *   $c \times d = 3 \times (-11) = -33$
*   **Calculate $ab$:**
    *   $a \times b = (-6) \times 7 = -42$
*   **Calculate $a+b$:**
    *   $a+b = (-6) + 7 = 1$
*   **Calculate $c+d$:**
    *   $c+d = 3 + (-11) = -8$
*   **Apply the formula:**
    $$ x = \frac{-33 - (-42)}{1 - (-8)} $$
    $$ x = \frac{-33 + 42}{1 + 8} $$
    $$ x = \frac{9}{9} $$
    $$ x = 1 $$
*   **Result:** $x = 1$

*Key Points:*

*   This Vedic Math technique, based on the Sunyam Samya Samuchyah Sutra, allows for very quick solutions to specific algebraic equations.
*   It is particularly useful in competitive exams like UPSC, SSC CGL, and Olympiads where time is a critical factor.
*   Understanding this formula avoids the need for lengthy expansion and simplification of quadratic terms.
*   Always pay attention to the signs of the constants 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' when substituting them into the formula.

## Topic 33: Vedic Math Trick: Sunyam Samya Samuchyah (Model 3)

This trick provides a shortcut for solving algebraic equations of the form:
$$ \frac{m}{ax + b} + \frac{m}{cx + d} = 0 $$
where $m \ne 0$.

*How it works:*

1.  *Identify coefficients:* In the given equation, identify the coefficients 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
    *   'a' is the coefficient of 'x' in the first denominator.
    *   'b' is the constant term in the first denominator.
    *   'c' is the coefficient of 'x' in the second denominator.
    *   'd' is the constant term in the second denominator.
    *   The numerators ('m') must be identical and non-zero for this trick to apply.

2.  *Apply the formula:* The value of 'x' can be directly found using the formula:
    $$ x = -\left(\frac{b + d}{a + c}\right) $$

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{1}{3x - 2} + \frac{1}{2x - 1} = 0 $$
    *   Here, $m=1$.
    *   Identify coefficients: $a=3$, $b=-2$, $c=2$, $d=-1$.
    *   Apply formula:
        $$ x = -\left(\frac{-2 + (-1)}{3 + 2}\right) $$
        $$ x = -\left(\frac{-3}{5}\right) $$
        $$ x = \frac{3}{5} $$
    *   *Result:* $x = \frac{3}{5}$

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{1}{2x - 1} + \frac{1}{3x - 1} = 0 $$
    *   Here, $m=1$.
    *   Identify coefficients: $a=2$, $b=-1$, $c=3$, $d=-1$.
    *   Apply formula:
        $$ x = -\left(\frac{-1 + (-1)}{2 + 3}\right) $$
        $$ x = -\left(\frac{-2}{5}\right) $$
        $$ x = \frac{2}{5} $$
    *   *Result:* $x = \frac{2}{5}$

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is highly efficient for solving specific types of algebraic equations without lengthy cross-multiplication.
*   The numerators of both fractions *must* be identical (represented by 'm') and non-zero.
*   This method is useful for competitive exams and academic algebra problems, allowing for quick calculation of 'x'.

Okay, here's the data extracted from the video, following your requested schema:

## Topic 34: Sunyam Samya Samuchyah (Model 4)

This model of Sunyam Samya Samuchyah (Vedic Mathematics) provides a shortcut for solving algebraic equations of the form:
$$ \frac{n_1}{d_1} = \frac{n_2}{d_2} $$
where $n_1, d_1, n_2, d_2$ are expressions involving a variable (e.g., $x$) and constants.

*How it works:*

1.  *Identify the numerators and denominators:*
    *   $n_1$: Numerator on the left side of the equation.
    *   $d_1$: Denominator on the left side of the equation.
    *   $n_2$: Numerator on the right side of the equation.
    *   $d_2$: Denominator on the right side of the equation.

2.  *Apply the addition rule:* According to this sutra (principle), if the sum of the numerators is equal to the sum of the denominators, then this sum is equal to zero.
    More precisely, if $\frac{n_1}{d_1} = \frac{n_2}{d_2}$, and $n_1 + n_2 = d_1 + d_2$, then we can set $n_1 + n_2 = 0$ (or $d_1 + d_2 = 0$) to find the value of the variable.

    Alternatively, and as demonstrated in the video, we can sum the numerators and sum the denominators separately, and then equate these sums to zero.
    The principle used is: if $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$ then $\frac{a+c}{b+d} = \frac{a}{b}$ (if $b+d \neq 0$).
    In the context of Sunyam Samya Samuchyah, if the resulting numerator and denominator (after adding) are identical or proportional, we can set that expression to zero.

*General Formula (as derived from the video's examples):*

Given:
$$ \frac{n_1}{d_1} = \frac{n_2}{d_2} $$
If $n_1 + n_2 = d_1 + d_2 = K$ (where $K$ is some expression), then $K=0$.

*Steps for solving:*

1.  Add the numerators: $N_{sum} = n_1 + n_2$.
2.  Add the denominators: $D_{sum} = d_1 + d_2$.
3.  If $N_{sum} = D_{sum}$, then set this common sum to zero and solve for the variable.
    That is, if $n_1 + n_2 = d_1 + d_2$, then set $n_1 + n_2 = 0$ (or $d_1 + d_2 = 0$) and solve for $x$.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:* (Formula illustration, not a problem to solve)
    The formula presented is:
    $$ \frac{n_1 + n_2}{d_1 + d_2} $$
    The speaker explains that this is used when both the numerator and denominator sides of an equation contain variables and numbers.

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{3x + 4}{3x + 5} = \frac{3x + 5}{3x + 4} $$
    *   Identify components:
        *   $n_1 = 3x + 4$
        *   $d_1 = 3x + 5$
        *   $n_2 = 3x + 5$
        *   $d_2 = 3x + 4$
    *   Add numerators: $n_1 + n_2 = (3x + 4) + (3x + 5) = 6x + 9$
    *   Add denominators: $d_1 + d_2 = (3x + 5) + (3x + 4) = 6x + 9$
    *   Since $n_1 + n_2 = d_1 + d_2$, we set this sum to zero:
        $6x + 9 = 0$
    *   Solve for $x$:
        $6x = -9$
        $x = \frac{-9}{6}$
        $x = -\frac{3}{2}$

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{2x + 9}{2x + 7} = \frac{2x + 7}{2x + 9} $$
    *   Identify components:
        *   $n_1 = 2x + 9$
        *   $d_1 = 2x + 7$
        *   $n_2 = 2x + 7$
        *   $d_2 = 2x + 9$
    *   Add numerators: $n_1 + n_2 = (2x + 9) + (2x + 7) = 4x + 16$
    *   Add denominators: $d_1 + d_2 = (2x + 7) + (2x + 9) = 4x + 16$
    *   Since $n_1 + n_2 = d_1 + d_2$, we set this sum to zero:
        $4x + 16 = 0$
    *   Solve for $x$:
        $4x = -16$
        $x = \frac{-16}{4}$
        $x = -4$

*Key Points:*

*   This model is particularly useful for algebraic fractions where both sides of the equation contain expressions with variables and constants.
*   The core idea is to sum the numerators and sum the denominators. If these sums are equal, then that sum is equal to zero.
*   This method dramatically simplifies solving certain types of fractional algebraic equations.
*   It's important to recognize the specific pattern where $n_1 + n_2 = d_1 + d_2$ for this trick to apply efficiently.

## Topic 35: Sunyam Samya Samuchyah (Model 5)

This method provides a shortcut for solving algebraic equations of the form:
$$ \frac{1}{x \pm a} \pm \frac{1}{x \pm b} = \frac{1}{x \pm c} \pm \frac{1}{x \pm d} $$
where the sum or difference of the constants in the denominators can be paired to be equal.

*How it works:*

1.  *Identify the constants:* Extract the constant values (including their signs) from the denominators of each fraction.
    *   Example: For $\frac{1}{x-2} - \frac{1}{x-4} = \frac{1}{x-3} - \frac{1}{x-5}$, the constants are -2, -4, -3, -5.

2.  *Form equal pairs:* Identify two pairs of constants such that the sum (or difference, depending on the structure of the specific problem) of the constants within each pair is equal.
    *   Example 1 (from video, problem 2):
        *   Constants: -2, -4, -3, -5.
        *   Pairing: $(-2 \text{ and } -5)$ gives $-2 + (-5) = -7$.
        *   Pairing: $(-4 \text{ and } -3)$ gives $-4 + (-3) = -7$.
        *   Since both pairs sum to -7, the pairing is correct.

    *   Example 2 (from video, problem 1):
        *   Constants: +4, +6, +7, +3.
        *   Pairing: $(+4 \text{ and } +6)$ gives $4 + 6 = 10$.
        *   Pairing: $(+7 \text{ and } +3)$ gives $7 + 3 = 10$.
        *   Since both pairs sum to 10, the pairing is correct.

    *   Example 3 (from video, problem 3):
        *   Constants: +8, +5, +1, -2.
        *   Pairing: $(+8 \text{ and } -2)$ gives $8 + (-2) = 6$.
        *   Pairing: $(+5 \text{ and } +1)$ gives $5 + 1 = 6$.
        *   Since both pairs sum to 6, the pairing is correct.

3.  *Form the equation:* Once the equal pairs are identified, set `2x + (sum of constants in a pair) = 0` (if the original terms are added) or `2x - (difference of constants in a pair) = 0` (if the original terms are subtracted).
    *   More generally, if the equation is structured such that:
        $$ \frac{1}{x+a} + \frac{1}{x+b} = \frac{1}{x+c} + \frac{1}{x+d} \quad \text{and} \quad a+b = c+d $$
        Then the solution is:
        $$ 2x + (a+b) = 0 $$
    *   If the equation is structured such that:
        $$ \frac{1}{x+a} - \frac{1}{x+b} = \frac{1}{x+c} - \frac{1}{x+d} \quad \text{and} \quad a+d = b+c \quad (\text{after cross-multiplication for balancing}) $$
        The derivation involves a bit more algebraic manipulation to reach the simplified form. The key is that the sum of constants in one cross-pair (e.g., $x+a$ and $x+d$) equals the sum of constants in the other cross-pair ($x+b$ and $x+c$).
        Then the solution is:
        $$ 2x + (a+d) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 2x + (b+c) = 0 $$
        (Note: the video implicitly uses this pattern by directly adding the constants of the paired denominators from the original equation).

4.  *Solve for x:* Solve the resulting linear equation for 'x'.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:* (Problem 2 in video)
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{1}{x-2} - \frac{1}{x-4} = \frac{1}{x-3} - \frac{1}{x-5} $$
    *   Constants: -2, -4, -3, -5
    *   Pairing sum: $(-2) + (-5) = -7$ and $(-4) + (-3) = -7$.
    *   Equation: $2x + (-7) = 0$
    *   $2x = 7$
    *   *Result:* $x = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5$

*   *Example 2:* (Problem 1 in video)
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{1}{x+4} + \frac{1}{x+6} = \frac{1}{x+7} + \frac{1}{x+3} $$
    *   Constants: +4, +6, +7, +3
    *   Pairing sum: $(+4) + (+6) = 10$ and $(+7) + (+3) = 10$.
    *   Equation: $2x + 10 = 0$
    *   $2x = -10$
    *   *Result:* $x = \frac{-10}{2} = -5$

*   *Example 3:* (Problem 3 in video)
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{1}{x+8} - \frac{1}{x+5} = \frac{1}{x+1} - \frac{1}{x-2} $$
    *   Constants: +8, +5, +1, -2
    *   Pairing sum: $(+8) + (-2) = 6$ and $(+5) + (+1) = 6$.
    *   Equation: $2x + 6 = 0$
    *   $2x = -6$
    *   *Result:* $x = \frac{-6}{2} = -3$

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is applicable when the sum of constants in two selected pairs of denominators (either adjacent or cross-paired, depending on the operation) is equal.
*   The terms in the numerator must be 1.
*   This method dramatically simplifies the solution process for these specific algebraic equation patterns, avoiding complex fraction manipulation.

## Topic 36: VILOKANAM 

The Sutra 'Vilokanam' means 'Observation'. Generally, we come across problems that can be solved by mere observation. But we follow the same conventional procedure and obtain the solution. However, this Sutra enables us to observe the problem completely, find the pattern, and finally solve the problem by just observation.

*How it works:*

1.  *Identify the pattern:* Look for an equation where two fractions are added, and these fractions are reciprocals of each other (e.g., $x/y + y/x$). The right side of the equation will typically be a fraction where the denominator is the product of two numbers, and the numerator is the sum of the squares of those same two numbers.
2.  *Find the numbers:* Identify two numbers whose product equals the denominator of the right-hand side fraction and whose squares, when added together, equal the numerator of the right-hand side fraction.
3.  *Equate and solve:* Set one of the fractions from the left side of the original equation equal to one of the simplified fractions (formed by the numbers found in step 2) and solve for 'x'. Repeat this for the reciprocal fraction and the other simplified fraction to verify consistency.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   *Example 1:*
    *   Problem: $$ x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{5}{2} $$
    *   Observation: We need two numbers whose product is 2 and whose squares sum to 5.
    *   Numbers: 2 and 1. (Since $2 \times 1 = 2$ and $2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = 5$).
    *   Solution:
        *   Set $x = 2$. Then $1/x = 1/2$.
        *   $2 + 1/2 = 4/2 + 1/2 = 5/2$. This matches the equation.
        *   Therefore, $x=2$ is a solution.
        *   Alternatively, set $x = 1/2$. Then $1/x = 2$.
        *   $1/2 + 2 = 5/2$. This also matches.
        *   Therefore, $x=1/2$ is also a solution.

*   *Example 2:*
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{x}{x + 2} + \frac{x + 2}{x} = \frac{34}{15} $$
    *   Observation: We need two numbers whose product is 15 and whose squares sum to 34.
    *   Numbers: 5 and 3. (Since $5 \times 3 = 15$ and $5^2 + 3^2 = 25 + 9 = 34$).
    *   Solution:
        *   Case 1: Let $\frac{x}{x + 2} = \frac{3}{5}$.
            *   Cross-multiply: $5x = 3(x + 2)$
            *   $5x = 3x + 6$
            *   $2x = 6$
            *   $x = 3$
        *   Case 2: Let $\frac{x}{x + 2} = \frac{5}{3}$.
            *   Cross-multiply: $3x = 5(x + 2)$
            *   $3x = 5x + 10$
            *   $-2x = 10$
            *   $x = -5$
        *   The possible values for $x$ are 3 and -5.

*   *Example 3:*
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{x + 5}{x + 6} + \frac{x + 6}{x + 5} = \frac{113}{56} $$
    *   Observation: We need two numbers whose product is 56 and whose squares sum to 113.
    *   Numbers: 8 and 7. (Since $8 \times 7 = 56$ and $8^2 + 7^2 = 64 + 49 = 113$).
    *   Solution:
        *   Case 1: Let $\frac{x + 5}{x + 6} = \frac{8}{7}$.
            *   Cross-multiply: $7(x + 5) = 8(x + 6)$
            *   $7x + 35 = 8x + 48$
            *   $7x - 8x = 48 - 35$
            *   $-x = 13$
            *   $x = -13$
        *   Case 2: Let $\frac{x + 5}{x + 6} = \frac{7}{8}$.
            *   Cross-multiply: $8(x + 5) = 7(x + 6)$
            *   $8x + 40 = 7x + 42$
            *   $8x - 7x = 42 - 40$
            *   $x = 2$
        *   The possible values for $x$ are -13 and 2.

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is particularly useful when the equation involves a sum of a variable expression and its reciprocal.
*   The method relies on identifying two numbers that satisfy both the product and sum-of-squares conditions derived from the right-hand side fraction.
*   Once these numbers are identified, the problem simplifies to solving two linear equations, which is much faster than traditional algebraic methods.
*   Practice with various problems will help you quickly recognize the pattern and apply this Vilokanam Sutra effectively.

## **MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS**


## Topic 37: Irrational Numbers 

An **irrational number** is a real number that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \neq 0$. In other words, they are numbers that cannot be written as a ratio of two integers.

**Characteristics of Irrational Numbers:**

1.  **Non-terminating decimals:** When expressed in decimal form, irrational numbers continue infinitely without repeating any pattern of digits.
2.  **Non-repeating decimals:** The digits after the decimal point do not form a repeating sequence (unlike rational numbers like $\frac{1}{3} = 0.333...$ or $\frac{1}{7} = 0.142857142857...$).
3.  **Cannot be expressed as a fraction:** They cannot be written in the form $\frac{p}{q}$.

**Examples of Irrational Numbers:**

*   **Pi ($\pi$)**:
    *   $\pi \approx 3.1415926536...$
    *   The digits after the decimal point go on infinitely without any repeating pattern. This is a classic example of an irrational number.
*   **Square roots of non-perfect squares**:
    *   $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.41421356237...$
    *   $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205081...$
    *   $\sqrt{5} \approx 2.23606798...$
    *   $\sqrt{6} \approx 2.44948974...$
    *   $\sqrt{7} \approx 2.64575131...$
    *   $\sqrt{8} \approx 2.82842712...$
    *   $\sqrt{10} \approx 3.16227766...$
    *   For any positive integer $n$ that is not a perfect square (i.e., $n$ is not the square of another integer), $\sqrt{n}$ is an irrational number. This means its decimal representation will be non-terminating and non-repeating.

**Key Difference from Rational Numbers:**

*   **Rational Numbers:** Can be written as $\frac{p}{q}$ (fractions), and their decimal representations either terminate (e.g., $0.5$) or repeat (e.g., $0.333...$). Examples include integers, terminating decimals, and repeating decimals.
*   **Irrational Numbers:** Cannot be written as $\frac{p}{q}$, and their decimal representations are non-terminating and non-repeating.

**In summary:**

*   If a number's decimal representation goes on infinitely without repeating a pattern, it is an irrational number.
*   If a number is the square root of a non-perfect square, it is an irrational number.

## Topic 38: Rational Numbers

A rational number is any number that can be written as a fraction, where both the numerator (the top number) and the denominator (the bottom number) are integers, and the denominator is not equal to zero.
In other words, a rational number can be expressed as p/q, where p and q are both integers and q ≠ 0.

### Types of Rational Numbers

There are four types of rational numbers:

*   **Integers:** All positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero are integers.
    *   Examples: -2, 1, 0.
*   **Fractions made up of integers:** Any number that can be written in the form a/b, where 'a' and 'b' are integers and 'b' is not equal to zero.
    *   Examples: 2/3, -3/4, 2 1/3.
*   **Terminating decimal numbers:** Decimal numbers that have a finite number of digits after the decimal point. These can be expressed as a fraction.
    *   Example: 0.125 (which is 1/8).
*   **Non-terminating decimal numbers with infinitely repeating patterns:** Decimal numbers that have an infinite number of digits after the decimal point, but these digits follow a repeating pattern. These can also be expressed as a fraction.
    *   Example: 0.142857 (which is 1/7).

### Key Takeaways

*   Rational numbers are essentially fractions where the numerator and denominator are integers.
*   A crucial condition for a number to be rational is that its denominator must **never** be zero.
*   Integers, all types of fractions (proper, improper, mixed), terminating decimals, and non-terminating but repeating decimals are all classified as rational numbers.
*   Numbers like 0.13234... (where the digits do not repeat in a pattern) are **not** rational numbers.

## Topic 39: Algebraic Identities

This section focuses on important algebraic identities that are frequently encountered in academics and competitive exams. The instructor emphasizes the importance of memorizing these formulas for quick problem-solving.

### Key Identities:

The video presents a list of algebraic identities. The instructor highlights the following as particularly important:

1.  **Square of a Binomial:**
    *   $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$
    *   $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$
2.  **Difference of Squares:**
    *   $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$
3.  **Cube of a Binomial:**
    *   $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$
    *   $(a-b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3$
4.  **Square of a Trinomial:**
    *   $(a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca$
5.  **Sum of Cubes:**
    *   $a^3 + b^3 = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$
6.  **Difference of Cubes:**
    *   $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$
7.  **Product of Two Binomials:**
    *   $(x+a)(x+b) = x^2 + (a+b)x + ab$ (less frequently asked in competitive exams, but important for academic understanding)
8.  **Special Identity:**
    *   $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca)$
    *   **Conditional form:** If $a+b+c = 0$, then $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$

### How to apply the Special Identity ($a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc$):

This identity is particularly important for competitive exams, where questions are often designed to be solved quickly by recognizing this pattern.

*   **Understanding the conditional form:** If the sum of the three variables ($a+b+c$) is zero, then the entire expression $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc$ simplifies to $0$, meaning $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc$.
*   **Problem-solving strategy:** When faced with problems involving this identity, look for conditions where $a+b+c=0$. If this condition holds, the solution becomes straightforward. If not, the expanded form of the identity is used.

### Examples from the video (with solutions):

**Example 1:**
*   **Problem:** If $a+b+c = 6$, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 14$ and $ab+bc+ca = 11$, what is $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc$?
*   **Solution Strategy:** We need to find the value of $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc$. We know the formula:
    $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - (ab + bc + ca))$
    *Note: The instructor simplifies $-(ab+bc+ca)$ in the solution by subtracting the sum of products.*
*   **Given values:**
    *   $a+b+c = 6$
    *   $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 14$
    *   $ab+bc+ca = 11$
*   **Calculation:**
    $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (6)(14 - 11)$
    $ = 6 \times 3$
    $ = 18$
*   **Result:** The value of $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc$ is 18.

**Example 2:**
*   **Problem:** If $(x-3)^2 + (y-4)^2 + (z+7)^2 = 0$, then find the value of $x^3 + y^3 + z^3$.
*   **Solution Strategy:** The sum of squares is zero only if each individual term is zero.
    *   $x-3 = 0 \implies x = 3$
    *   $y-4 = 0 \implies y = 4$
    *   $z+7 = 0 \implies z = -7$
    Now we need to find $x^3 + y^3 + z^3$. Let's check the sum $x+y+z$:
    $x+y+z = 3 + 4 + (-7) = 7 - 7 = 0$
    Since $x+y+z = 0$, we can use the conditional form of the special identity: $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3xyz$.
*   **Calculation:**
    $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 \times x \times y \times z$
    $ = 3 \times 3 \times 4 \times (-7)$
    $ = 9 \times 4 \times (-7)$
    $ = 36 \times (-7)$
    $ = -252$
*   **Result:** The value of $x^3 + y^3 + z^3$ is -252.

**Example 3:**
*   **Problem:** Simplify: $\frac{1.2 \times 1.2 \times 1.2 - 0.2 \times 0.2 \times 0.2}{1.2 \times 1.2 + 1.2 \times 0.2 + 0.2 \times 0.2}$
*   **Solution Strategy:** Recognize the pattern in the expression.
    Let $a = 1.2$ and $b = 0.2$.
    The expression becomes: $\frac{a \times a \times a - b \times b \times b}{a \times a + a \times b + b \times b} = \frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^2 + ab + b^2}$
    We know the identity for difference of cubes: $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$.
    Substitute this into the expression: $\frac{(a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)}{a^2 + ab + b^2}$
    The term $(a^2 + ab + b^2)$ cancels out, leaving us with $a-b$.
*   **Calculation:**
    $a-b = 1.2 - 0.2 = 1.0 = 1$
*   **Result:** The simplified value of the expression is 1.

### Key Points:
*   **Memorize formulas:** It is crucial to memorize all algebraic identities for efficient problem-solving.
*   **Recognize patterns:** Practice helps in quickly identifying which identity applies to a given problem.
*   **Competitive vs. Academic:** While all identities are important, some (like the special identity $a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc$) are highly tested in competitive exams due to their potential for quick solutions under specific conditions.


## Topic 40: Perfect Numbers

**Definition:**
A **perfect number** (Malayalam: പരിപൂർണ്ണ സംഖ്യ, അനഘ സംഖ്യ) is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (positive divisors excluding the number itself).

**How to identify a perfect number:**

1.  **Find all divisors:** List all the positive integers that divide the given number evenly.
2.  **Exclude the number itself:** Remove the number itself from the list of divisors. These are called proper divisors.
3.  **Sum the proper divisors:** Add all the proper divisors together.
4.  **Compare the sum to the original number:** If the sum of the proper divisors is equal to the original number, then the number is a perfect number.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Smallest Perfect Number: 6**
    *   **Divisors of 6:** 1, 2, 3, 6
    *   **Proper divisors of 6:** 1, 2, 3 (excluding 6)
    *   **Sum of proper divisors:** 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
    *   **Result:** Since the sum (6) is equal to the original number (6), 6 is a perfect number. It is also the only single-digit perfect number.

*   **Next Perfect Number: 28**
    *   **Divisors of 28:** 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
    *   **Proper divisors of 28:** 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 (excluding 28)
    *   **Sum of proper divisors:** 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28
    *   **Result:** Since the sum (28) is equal to the original number (28), 28 is a perfect number.

**Other Perfect Numbers mentioned in the video:**

*   496
*   8,128

**Key Points:**

*   Perfect numbers are relatively rare.
*   The video lists the first few perfect numbers: 6, 28, 496, and 8,128.
*   The concept of perfect numbers dates back to ancient Greek mathematics.







## 1.Trigonometry Values Trick

This trick helps in remembering the values of trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, and tangent) for specific angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°) using your fingers.

**How it works (for Sine and Cosine):**

1.  **Assign Angles to Fingers:** Hold your right hand up, palm facing you. Assign the following angles to your fingers, starting from your thumb:
    *   Thumb: 0°
    *   Index finger: 30°
    *   Middle finger: 45°
    *   Ring finger: 60°
    *   Pinky finger: 90°

2.  **Memorize the Formula:** The general formula for both sine and cosine is:
    $$ \frac{\sqrt{x}}{2} $$
    Where 'x' represents the number of fingers.

3.  **To Find Sine (Clockwise Counting):**
    *   **Fold the finger** corresponding to the angle you want to find.
    *   **Count the number of fingers** to the *right* (clockwise) of the folded finger. This number is your 'x'.
    *   Substitute 'x' into the formula $\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2}$.

    *   **Example: sin 30°**
        1.  Fold your index finger (30°).
        2.  Count fingers to the right: There is 1 finger (the thumb). So, $x=1$.
        3.  Result: $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$

    *   **Example: sin 60°**
        1.  Fold your ring finger (60°).
        2.  Count fingers to the right: There are 3 fingers (thumb, index, middle). So, $x=3$.
        3.  Result: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

    *   **Example: sin 90°**
        1.  Fold your pinky finger (90°).
        2.  Count fingers to the right: There are 4 fingers (thumb, index, middle, ring). So, $x=4$.
        3.  Result: $\frac{\sqrt{4}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$

4.  **To Find Cosine (Anti-Clockwise Counting):**
    *   **Fold the finger** corresponding to the angle you want to find.
    *   **Count the number of fingers** to the *left* (anti-clockwise) of the folded finger. This number is your 'x'.
    *   Substitute 'x' into the formula $\frac{\sqrt{x}}{2}$.

    *   **Example: cos 30°**
        1.  Fold your index finger (30°).
        2.  Count fingers to the left: There are 3 fingers (middle, ring, pinky). So, $x=3$.
        3.  Result: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$

    *   **Example: cos 60°**
        1.  Fold your ring finger (60°).
        2.  Count fingers to the left: There is 1 finger (the pinky). So, $x=1$.
        3.  Result: $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$

    *   **Example: cos 90°**
        1.  Fold your pinky finger (90°).
        2.  Count fingers to the left: There are 0 fingers. So, $x=0$.
        3.  Result: $\frac{\sqrt{0}}{2} = 0$

**How it works (for Tangent):**

1.  **Memorize the Tangent Formula:**
    $$ \tan(\text{angle}) = \frac{\sqrt{\text{fingers to the right (clockwise)}}}{\sqrt{\text{fingers to the left (anti-clockwise)}}} $$

2.  **Example: tan 30°**
    *   Fold your index finger (30°).
    *   Fingers to the right: 1 (thumb).
    *   Fingers to the left: 3 (middle, ring, pinky).
    *   Result: $\frac{\sqrt{1}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$

3.  **Example: tan 60°**
    *   Fold your ring finger (60°).
    *   Fingers to the right: 3 (thumb, index, middle).
    *   Fingers to the left: 1 (pinky).
    *   Result: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{1}} = \sqrt{3}$

**Key Points:**

*   This finger trick is a visual and kinesthetic way to quickly recall trigonometric values for common angles.
*   It's particularly useful for angles 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°.
*   For cosecant, secant, and cotangent, remember that they are the reciprocals of sine, cosine, and tangent respectively.
    *   `cosec A = 1/sin A`
    *   `sec A = 1/cos A`
    *   `cot A = 1/tan A`
*   Practice this trick regularly to ensure proficiency.

**Example Problems from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Problem 1: The value of the expression $\frac{\sin 30^\circ + \tan 45^\circ - \sec 60^\circ}{\csc 30^\circ - \cot 45^\circ - \cos 60^\circ}$**
    *   **Values:**
        *   $\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}$
        *   $\tan 45^\circ = 1$
        *   $\sec 60^\circ = \frac{1}{\cos 60^\circ} = \frac{1}{1/2} = 2$
        *   $\csc 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{1}{1/2} = 2$
        *   $\cot 45^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 45^\circ} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$
        *   $\cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}$
    *   **Calculation:**
        $$ \frac{\frac{1}{2} + 1 - 2}{2 - 1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1 + 2 - 4}{2}}{\frac{4 - 2 - 1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{-1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = -1 $$
    *   **Result:** -1

*   **Problem 2: $\sin 60^\circ \cos 30^\circ + \sin 30^\circ \cos 60^\circ$**
    *   **Values:**
        *   $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
        *   $\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
        *   $\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}$
        *   $\cos 60^\circ = \frac{1}{2}$
    *   **Calculation:**
        $$ \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3 + 1}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 $$
    *   **Result:** 1

*   **Problem 3: $2\tan^2 45^\circ + \cos^2 30^\circ - \sin^2 60^\circ$**
    *   **Values:**
        *   $\tan 45^\circ = 1$
        *   $\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
        *   $\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
    *   **Calculation:**
        $$ 2(1)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 2(1) + \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4} = 2 + 0 = 2 $$
    *   **Result:** 2
    * ## 2.Quadratic Formula Shortcut

This trick provides a shortcut for finding the roots (x-values) of a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ without directly using the full quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. This method focuses on finding two numbers that satisfy specific sum and product conditions related to the coefficients.

**Conditions for Real Solutions (Discriminant):**

Before applying the shortcut, it's useful to know the nature of the solutions based on the discriminant ($D = b^2 - 4ac$):

*   **$b^2 - 4ac > 0$**: Two distinct real solutions.
*   **$b^2 - 4ac = 0$**: One real solution (a repeated root).
*   **$b^2 - 4ac < 0$**: Zero real solutions (two complex solutions).

**How the Shortcut Works:**

1.  **Multiply 'a' and 'c':** Multiply the coefficient of $x^2$ (a) by the constant term (c). Let this product be 'P'.
    *   *Example 1:* For $6x^2 - 17x + 12 = 0$, $a=6$, $c=12$. So, $P = 6 \times 12 = 72$.
    *   *Example 2:* For $4x^2 + 15x + 9 = 0$, $a=4$, $c=9$. So, $P = 4 \times 9 = 36$.
    *   *Example 3:* For $3x^2 - 2x - 5 = 0$, $a=3$, $c=-5$. So, $P = 3 \times (-5) = -15$.

2.  **Find two numbers:** Find two numbers (let's call them $n_1$ and $n_2$) such that:
    *   Their product ($n_1 \times n_2$) equals the value 'P' (from step 1).
    *   Their sum ($n_1 + n_2$) equals the coefficient of 'x' (b).
    *   *Example 1:* For $6x^2 - 17x + 12 = 0$, $b=-17$. We need two numbers that multiply to 72 and add to -17. These numbers are -8 and -9. (Note: The video shows 12 and 6 with a sum of 18, which is incorrect for this step based on the equation's 'b' value).
    *   *Example 2:* For $4x^2 + 15x + 9 = 0$, $b=15$. We need two numbers that multiply to 36 and add to 15. These numbers are 9 and 4.
    *   *Example 3:* For $3x^2 - 2x - 5 = 0$, $b=-2$. We need two numbers that multiply to -15 and add to -2. These numbers are -5 and 3.

3.  **Change the signs:** Change the signs of the two numbers found in step 2.
    *   *Example 1:* -8 and -9 become +8 and +9.
    *   *Example 2:* 9 and 4 become -9 and -4.
    *   *Example 3:* -5 and 3 become +5 and -3.

4.  **Divide by 'a':** Divide each of the sign-changed numbers by the coefficient 'a' (from step 1).
    *   *Example 1:* For $6x^2 - 17x + 12 = 0$, $a=6$.
        *   $x_1 = \frac{+8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}$
        *   $x_2 = \frac{+9}{6} = \frac{3}{2}$
    *   *Example 2:* For $4x^2 + 15x + 9 = 0$, $a=4$.
        *   $x_1 = \frac{-9}{4}$
        *   $x_2 = \frac{-4}{4} = -1$
    *   *Example 3:* For $3x^2 - 2x - 5 = 0$, $a=3$.
        *   $x_1 = \frac{+5}{3}$
        *   $x_2 = \frac{-3}{3} = -1$

**Examples from the video (with corrections where needed):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $6x^2 - 17x + 12 = 0$
    *   Step 1: $a \times c = 6 \times 12 = 72$
    *   Step 2: Find two numbers that multiply to 72 and add to -17. These are -8 and -9.
    *   Step 3: Change signs: +8 and +9.
    *   Step 4: Divide by $a=6$:
        *   $x_1 = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}$
        *   $x_2 = \frac{9}{6} = \frac{3}{2}$
    *   **Result (Corrected):** $x = \frac{4}{3}$ or $x = \frac{3}{2}$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $4x^2 + 15x + 9 = 0$
    *   Step 1: $a \times c = 4 \times 9 = 36$
    *   Step 2: Find two numbers that multiply to 36 and add to 15. These are 9 and 4.
    *   Step 3: Change signs: -9 and -4.
    *   Step 4: Divide by $a=4$:
        *   $x_1 = \frac{-9}{4}$
        *   $x_2 = \frac{-4}{4} = -1$
    *   **Result:** $x = -\frac{9}{4}$ or $x = -1$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $3x^2 - 2x - 5 = 0$
    *   Step 1: $a \times c = 3 \times (-5) = -15$
    *   Step 2: Find two numbers that multiply to -15 and add to -2. These are -5 and 3.
    *   Step 3: Change signs: +5 and -3.
    *   Step 4: Divide by $a=3$:
        *   $x_1 = \frac{5}{3}$
        *   $x_2 = \frac{-3}{3} = -1$
    *   **Result:** $x = \frac{5}{3}$ or $x = -1$
    * ## 3.Funny Ratios Trick

This trick is for simplifying ratios of large numbers quickly, particularly useful in competitive exams. The core idea is to find a common multiplicative or divisive factor between the corresponding halves of the numbers in the ratio.

**How it works:**

1.  **Split the numbers:** Divide each number in the ratio into two parts (usually the first two digits and the last two digits).
    *   Example: For the ratio 2448:2346, split it into 24:48 and 23:46.

2.  **Identify the relationship:** Look for a multiplicative or divisive relationship between the first part and the second part of each split number.
    *   Example 1 (2448:2346):
        *   For 24:48, 48 is $24 \times 2$.
        *   For 23:46, 46 is $23 \times 2$.
    *   Example 2 (1236:824):
        *   For 12:36, 36 is $12 \times 3$.
        *   For 8:24, 24 is $8 \times 3$.
    *   Example 3 (735:840):
        *   For 7:35, 35 is $7 \times 5$.
        *   For 8:40, 40 is $8 \times 5$.

3.  **Cancel the related parts:** If both numbers in the ratio follow the same multiplicative or divisive pattern (e.g., both are doubled, tripled, or divided by the same factor in their split parts), you can cancel out the second parts and form a new ratio with the first parts.
    *   Example 1: Since both 48 and 46 are doubles of 24 and 23 respectively, you can effectively cancel out the "doubling" part.
    *   Example 2: Since both 36 and 24 are three times 12 and 8 respectively, you can cancel out the "tripling" part.
    *   Example 3: Since both 35 and 40 are five times 7 and 8 respectively, you can cancel out the "multiplying by 5" part.

4.  **Simplify the new ratio (if necessary):** The new ratio formed by the remaining parts can then be simplified further by finding common factors.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: 2448:2346
    *   Split: 24:48 and 23:46
    *   Relationship: $24 \times 2 = 48$, $23 \times 2 = 46$. Both parts are multiplied by 2.
    *   Cancel the multiplied parts (48 and 46).
    *   Remaining ratio: 24:23
    *   **Result:** 24:23

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: 1236:824
    *   Split: 12:36 and 8:24
    *   Relationship: $12 \times 3 = 36$, $8 \times 3 = 24$. Both parts are multiplied by 3.
    *   Cancel the multiplied parts (36 and 24).
    *   Remaining ratio: 12:8
    *   Simplify 12:8 by dividing both by 4: 3:2
    *   **Result:** 3:2

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: 735:840
    *   Split: 7:35 and 8:40
    *   Relationship: $7 \times 5 = 35$, $8 \times 5 = 40$. Both parts are multiplied by 5.
    *   Cancel the multiplied parts (35 and 40).
    *   Remaining ratio: 7:8
    *   **Result:** 7:8

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is applicable when the numbers in the ratio can be split such that the second part of each number is a multiple (or divisor) of its first part by the *same factor*.
*   It's a quick mental math trick for competitive exams.
*   It's important to recognize the multiplicative/divisive relationship between the split parts for both numbers in the ratio.
*   This method is primarily for multiplication/division relationships, not addition or subtraction.
* ## 4.Special Fractions (Ladder/Continued Fractions) Trick

This trick is designed for simplifying complex nested fractions, often called ladder or continued fractions, which are frequently seen in competitive exams and olympiads. The method involves simplifying the fraction from the bottom up, layer by layer.

**How it works:**

1.  **Start from the innermost mixed fraction:** Identify the lowest mixed fraction in the expression. Convert this mixed fraction into an improper fraction.
    *   Example: In the expression $1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{2}{2+\frac{3}{1+\frac{4}{5}}}}$, the innermost mixed fraction is $1+\frac{4}{5}$.

2.  **Move the denominator up:** Once you convert a mixed fraction to an improper fraction ($ \frac{a}{b} $), if it's in the denominator of another fraction like $ \frac{C}{\frac{a}{b}} $, you can move 'b' to the numerator to get $ \frac{C \times b}{a} $.

3.  **Repeat the process:** Continue this process of converting the lowest mixed fraction to an improper fraction and moving its denominator up until the entire expression is simplified.

**Example from the video (with solution):**

*   **Problem:**
    $$ 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{2}{2+\frac{3}{1+\frac{4}{5}}}} $$

*   **Step 1: Innermost mixed fraction:**
    $1+\frac{4}{5} = \frac{1 \times 5 + 4}{5} = \frac{9}{5}$

*   **Step 2: Substitute and simplify the next layer:**
    The expression becomes:
    $$ 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{2}{2+\frac{3}{\frac{9}{5}}}} $$
    Now, simplify $ \frac{3}{\frac{9}{5}} $:
    $ \frac{3}{\frac{9}{5}} = \frac{3 \times 5}{9} = \frac{15}{9} $
    The expression becomes:
    $$ 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{2}{2+\frac{15}{9}}} $$

*   **Step 3: Simplify the next mixed fraction:**
    $2+\frac{15}{9} = \frac{2 \times 9 + 15}{9} = \frac{18 + 15}{9} = \frac{33}{9}$
    The expression becomes:
    $$ 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{2}{\frac{33}{9}}} $$

*   **Step 4: Move the denominator up and simplify:**
    Simplify $ \frac{2}{\frac{33}{9}} $:
    $ \frac{2}{\frac{33}{9}} = \frac{2 \times 9}{33} = \frac{18}{33} $
    The expression becomes:
    $$ 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{18}{33}} $$

*   **Step 5: Simplify the next mixed fraction:**
    $1+\frac{18}{33} = \frac{1 \times 33 + 18}{33} = \frac{33 + 18}{33} = \frac{51}{33}$
    The expression becomes:
    $$ 1+\frac{1}{\frac{51}{33}} $$

*   **Step 6: Move the denominator up and simplify:**
    Simplify $ \frac{1}{\frac{51}{33}} $:
    $ \frac{1}{\frac{51}{33}} = \frac{1 \times 33}{51} = \frac{33}{51} $
    The expression becomes:
    $$ 1+\frac{33}{51} $$

*   **Step 7: Final simplification:**
    $1+\frac{33}{51} = \frac{1 \times 51 + 33}{51} = \frac{51 + 33}{51} = \frac{84}{51}$

*   **Result:** The final simplified fraction is $\frac{84}{51}$.

**Key Points:**

*   Always start from the bottom-most, innermost part of the fraction.
*   Convert mixed fractions to improper fractions at each step.
*   When you have a fraction in the denominator (e.g., $ \frac{A}{\frac{B}{C}} $), multiply the numerator by the denominator of the inner fraction (i.e., $ \frac{A \times C}{B} $).
*   Practice doing these steps mentally or with minimal writing to save time in exams.
* ## 5.Algebra Simplification Tricks

This section presents quick tricks for solving common algebraic problems, especially those involving systems of linear equations and expressions with reciprocals. These methods aim to provide a faster way to arrive at the solution compared to traditional algebraic manipulation.

**Trick 1: Finding individual variables from sum and difference**

If you are given the sum and difference of two variables (e.g., $X+Y$ and $X-Y$), you can quickly find the individual values of $X$ and $Y$.

**How it works:**

1.  **To find X (the first variable):** Add the two given values (sum and difference) and divide by 2.
    *   Formula: $X = \frac{(X+Y) + (X-Y)}{2}$

2.  **To find Y (the second variable):** Subtract the difference from the sum and divide by 2.
    *   Formula: $Y = \frac{(X+Y) - (X-Y)}{2}$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Given: $X+Y=30$, $X-Y=10$
    *   To find X: $X = \frac{30 + 10}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20$
    *   To find Y: $Y = \frac{30 - 10}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10$
    *   **Result:** $X=20$, $Y=10$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Given: $X+Y=48$, $X-Y=14$
    *   To find X: $X = \frac{48 + 14}{2} = \frac{62}{2} = 31$
    *   To find Y: $Y = \frac{48 - 14}{2} = \frac{34}{2} = 17$
    *   **Result:** $X=31$, $Y=17$

**Trick 2: Finding the sum of reciprocals when sum and product are given**

If you are given the sum of two variables ($X+Y$) and their product ($XY$), you can quickly find the sum of their reciprocals ($\frac{1}{X} + \frac{1}{Y}$).

**How it works:**

1.  **Form the fraction:** The sum of the reciprocals will be equal to the sum of the variables divided by their product.
    *   Formula: $\frac{1}{X} + \frac{1}{Y} = \frac{X+Y}{XY}$

**Example from the video (with solution):**

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Given: $X+Y=30$, $XY=10$
    *   To find $\frac{1}{X} + \frac{1}{Y}$: $\frac{1}{X} + \frac{1}{Y} = \frac{30}{10} = 3$
    *   **Result:** $\frac{1}{X} + \frac{1}{Y} = 3$

**Key Points:**

*   These tricks are shortcuts for specific algebraic structures and can save significant time in exams.
*   Understanding the underlying algebraic principles (e.g., elimination method for systems of equations, common denominator for adding fractions) can help in remembering and applying these tricks correctly.
*   Practice these methods to become proficient in their rapid application.
* ## 6.Reciprocal Identities in Trigonometry

This section focuses on the reciprocal identities in trigonometry, which define the relationship between the primary trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) and their reciprocals (cosecant, secant, cotangent). These identities are fundamental in solving trigonometric problems, especially in higher secondary education and competitive exams.

**Reciprocal Identities:**

The core reciprocal identities are:

*   **Cosecant (csc):** The reciprocal of sine.
    $$ \csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta} $$
    Conversely, this also means $ \sin \theta = \frac{1}{\csc \theta} $.

*   **Secant (sec):** The reciprocal of cosine.
    $$ \sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} $$
    Conversely, this also means $ \cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sec \theta} $.

*   **Cotangent (cot):** The reciprocal of tangent.
    $$ \cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} $$
    Conversely, this also means $ \tan \theta = \frac{1}{\cot \theta} $.

**How it works (for basic problems):**

When asked to find the reciprocal of a trigonometric function, simply invert the given value.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: If $ \sin A = 1/3 $, find $ \csc A $.
    *   Since $ \csc A $ is the reciprocal of $ \sin A $, we simply invert the value of $ \sin A $.
    *   **Result:** $ \csc A = \frac{1}{1/3} = 3 $.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: Find the reciprocal of $ \sin 70 $.
    *   The reciprocal of $ \sin \theta $ is $ \csc \theta $.
    *   **Result:** The reciprocal of $ \sin 70^\circ $ is $ \frac{1}{\sin 70^\circ} = \csc 70^\circ $.

**Key Points:**

*   These identities are crucial for simplifying trigonometric expressions and solving equations.
*   Understanding that a reciprocal simply means "1 divided by" the original function is key.
*   In practical application, especially in competitive exams, you might encounter problems where these basic identities are clubbed with other trigonometric formulas (like half-angle, double-angle, or product-to-sum formulas), requiring a deeper understanding and practice.
*   Memorizing these three core reciprocal identities and their inverse relationships is essential.
* ## 7.Fraction Addition (Power of Two) Trick

This trick offers a rapid method for adding a series of fractions where the denominators are consecutive powers of two, starting from $1/2$. This pattern frequently appears in competitive exams.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the pattern:** The trick applies to sums of fractions in the form $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \dots + \frac{1}{2^n}$. The denominators must be consecutive powers of two.

2.  **Determine the last denominator:** The last denominator in the series ($2^n$) will be the denominator of your final answer.

3.  **Calculate the numerator:** The numerator of your final answer will be one less than the last denominator.

**General Formula:**

$$ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \dots + \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{2^n - 1}{2^n} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} $
    *   Last denominator: 16
    *   Numerator: $16 - 1 = 15$
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{15}{16} $

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{64} $
    *   Last denominator: 64
    *   Numerator: $64 - 1 = 63$
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{63}{64} $

**Trick for "1 + sum of fractions with powers of two":**

If the series starts with '1 + ' followed by fractions with consecutive powers of two in the denominator, the approach changes slightly.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the pattern:** The trick applies to sums of fractions in the form $1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \dots + \frac{1}{2^n}$.

2.  **Determine the last denominator:** The last denominator in the series ($2^n$) will be the denominator of the fractional part of your final answer.

3.  **Calculate the numerator of the fractional part:** The numerator of the fractional part will be one less than the last denominator.

4.  **Add the whole number:** The whole number '1' will be added to this resulting fraction.
    *   Formula: $1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \dots + \frac{1}{2^n} = 1 + \frac{2^n - 1}{2^n} = \frac{2^n + 2^n - 1}{2^n} = \frac{2^{n+1} - 1}{2^n}$ (or simplified as $1 + \frac{\text{last denominator - 1}}{\text{last denominator}}$)

**Example from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{64}$
    *   Last denominator: 64
    *   Numerator (for fractional part): $64 - 1 = 63$
    *   Combine with 1: $1 + \frac{63}{64}$
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{127}{64} $ (by converting $1 + \frac{63}{64}$ to an improper fraction)

**Trick for finding a missing term to make the sum equal to 1:**

If you have a series of fractions with consecutive powers of two in the denominator, and the sum plus an unknown 'X' equals 1, you can quickly find 'X'.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the pattern:** The problem is in the form $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \dots + \frac{1}{2^n} + X = 1$.

2.  **Determine the missing term:** The value of X will be equal to the last fraction in the sequence if the sequence were to continue to 1. In other words, X is the next power of two in the sequence.

**Example from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: $ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + X = 1 $. Find $X$.
    *   The next consecutive power of two after $1/8$ is $1/16$. However, the video solution indicates that $X$ is the value that would complete the sum to 1. Using the formula from the first trick, the sum of $1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8$ is $7/8$.
    *   So, $7/8 + X = 1$.
    *   **Result:** $X = 1 - 7/8 = 1/8$. (Note: The video explicitly states that X is the value immediately preceding the one that would make the sum to 1 in the continuous sequence of powers of 2. In the example given, $1/2+1/4+1/8+X=1$, and the solution shows $X=1/8$. This means that if the question was $1/2+1/4+X=1$, then $X$ would be $1/4$ as $1/2+1/4=3/4$ and $1-3/4=1/4$. This suggests X would be equal to the last term shown if the sum reached 1.)

*   **Example 5:**
    *   Problem: $ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + X = 1 $. Find $X$.
    *   Using the first trick, the sum of $ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} $ is $ \frac{15}{16} $.
    *   So, $ \frac{15}{16} + X = 1 $.
    *   **Result:** $X = 1 - \frac{15}{16} = \frac{1}{16}$. (Again, this confirms that X is the last term if the series sums to 1).

**Key Points:**

*   These tricks rely on the specific nature of fractions with powers of two as denominators.
*   The key is to recognize the pattern of consecutive powers of two.
*   These methods bypass the need for finding a common denominator, significantly speeding up calculations.
*   Practice with various series to solidify your understanding and application of these tricks.
* ## 8.Fraction (99th Number) Trick

This trick is for quickly multiplying a mixed number of the form $99 \frac{AB}{99}$ by 99. This type of problem often appears in competitive exams where speed is crucial.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the pattern:** The trick works specifically for mixed numbers where the whole number is 99, the denominator of the fraction is 99, and this mixed number is then multiplied by 99. The numerator (AB) can be any two-digit number.
    *   Example: $99 \frac{45}{99} \times 99$

2.  **Write down "98":** The first two digits of your answer will always be 98. This is derived from $(99-1)$.

3.  **Find the next digits:** Look at the numerator of the original fraction (AB). Add 1 to this number. This will form the next two digits of your answer.
    *   Example: For $99 \frac{45}{99} \times 99$, the numerator is 45. Add 1 to 45 to get 46.

4.  **Combine the parts:** Concatenate the "98" with the new two-digit number to get the final answer.

**General Formula:**

$$ 99 \frac{AB}{99} \times 99 = 98 (AB+1) $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $99 \frac{45}{99} \times 99$
    *   First part: 98
    *   Numerator + 1: $45 + 1 = 46$
    *   **Result:** 9846

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $99 \frac{38}{99} \times 99$
    *   First part: 98
    *   Numerator + 1: $38 + 1 = 39$
    *   **Result:** 9839

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $99 \frac{90}{99} \times 99$
    *   First part: 98
    *   Numerator + 1: $90 + 1 = 91$
    *   **Result:** 9891

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: $99 \frac{81}{99} \times 99$
    *   First part: 98
    *   Numerator + 1: $81 + 1 = 82$
    *   **Result:** 9882

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is a mental math shortcut, allowing you to solve these specific problems almost instantly.
*   It bypasses the need for converting the mixed number to an improper fraction and then performing a large multiplication.
*   The pattern must be exactly $99 \frac{AB}{99} \times 99$. Variations in the numbers would require standard calculation methods.
*   Practice helps in quickly recognizing the pattern and applying the trick effectively.
* ## 9.Unit Digit of the Product Trick

This section provides methods for quickly determining the unit digit of a product, even when dealing with very large numbers or numbers raised to large powers. This is a common type of question in competitive exams.

**Trick 1: Unit digit of a product of multiple numbers**

To find the unit digit of a product of several numbers, you only need to focus on the unit digit of each number.

**How it works:**

1.  **Extract unit digits:** Take the unit digit of each number in the product.
2.  **Multiply unit digits sequentially:** Multiply these unit digits together. If the product of two unit digits results in a two-digit number, only consider the unit digit of that product for the next multiplication.
3.  **Final unit digit:** The final unit digit obtained is the unit digit of the entire product.

**Example from the video (with solution):**

*   **Problem:** Find the unit digit in the product $(784 \times 618 \times 917 \times 463)$.
*   Unit digits: 4, 8, 7, 3
*   Sequential multiplication:
    *   $4 \times 8 = 32$ (Unit digit is 2)
    *   $2 \times 7 = 14$ (Unit digit is 4)
    *   $4 \times 3 = 12$ (Unit digit is 2)
*   **Result:** The unit digit of the product is 2.

**Trick 2: Unit digit of a sum of multiple numbers**

To find the unit digit of a sum of several numbers, you only need to focus on the unit digit of each number.

**How it works:**

1.  **Extract unit digits:** Take the unit digit of each number in the sum.
2.  **Add unit digits sequentially:** Add these unit digits together. If the sum of two unit digits results in a two-digit number, only consider the unit digit of that sum for the next addition.
3.  **Final unit digit:** The final unit digit obtained is the unit digit of the entire sum.

**Example from the video (with solution):**

*   **Problem:** Find the unit digit in the sum $(784 + 315 + 613)$.
*   Unit digits: 4, 5, 3
*   Sequential addition:
    *   $4 + 5 = 9$
    *   $9 + 3 = 12$ (Unit digit is 2)
*   **Result:** The unit digit of the sum is 2.

**Trick 3: Unit digit of a number raised to a large power**

This trick involves understanding the cyclical nature of unit digits when a number is raised to increasing powers.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify invariant unit digits:**
    *   If the unit digit of the base is 0, 1, 5, or 6, the unit digit of any positive integer power will be the same (0, 1, 5, or 6, respectively).
    *   Example: $625^{317}$ will have a unit digit of 5.
    *   Example: $341^{491}$ will have a unit digit of 1.
    *   Example: A number ending in 6 raised to any power will end in 6.

2.  **For other unit digits (2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9):**
    *   **Determine the cycle length:** Calculate the first few powers of the unit digit to find the repeating pattern (cycle). The cycle length for 2, 3, 7, 8 is 4. The cycle length for 4, 9 is 2.
        *   For unit digit 4: $4^1 = \underline{4}$, $4^2 = 1\underline{6}$, $4^3 = 6\underline{4}$, $4^4 = 25\underline{6}$. The pattern is 4, 6, 4, 6... (cycle length 2).
        *   For unit digit 2: $2^1 = \underline{2}$, $2^2 = \underline{4}$, $2^3 = \underline{8}$, $2^4 = 1\underline{6}$, $2^5 = 3\underline{2}$. The pattern is 2, 4, 8, 6, 2... (cycle length 4).
    *   **Divide the exponent:** Take the last two digits of the exponent and divide it by the cycle length (usually 4 for 2, 3, 7, 8, and 2 for 4, 9).
    *   **Find the remainder:**
        *   If the remainder is 1, the unit digit is the 1st digit in the cycle.
        *   If the remainder is 2, the unit digit is the 2nd digit in the cycle.
        *   If the remainder is 3, the unit digit is the 3rd digit in the cycle.
        *   If the remainder is 0 (or divisible by the cycle length), the unit digit is the last digit in the cycle.

**Example from the video (with solution):**

*   **Problem:** What is the unit digit in $\{(6374)^{1793} \times (625)^{317} \times (341)^{491}\}$
*   Break down each term:
    *   $(625)^{317}$: Unit digit of base is 5. So, the unit digit is 5.
    *   $(341)^{491}$: Unit digit of base is 1. So, the unit digit is 1.
    *   $(6374)^{1793}$: Unit digit of base is 4.
        *   Powers of 4: $4^1 = \underline{4}$, $4^2 = 1\underline{6}$, $4^3 = 6\underline{4}$, $4^4 = 25\underline{6}$. The cycle is (4, 6) with length 2.
        *   Exponent is 1793. Take the last two digits: 93.
        *   Divide 93 by 2 (cycle length): $93 \div 2 = 46$ with a remainder of 1.
        *   Since the remainder is 1, the unit digit is the 1st digit in the cycle, which is 4.

*   **Multiply the individual unit digits:**
    *   Unit digits are 4, 5, 1.
    *   $4 \times 5 = 20$ (Unit digit is 0)
    *   $0 \times 1 = 0$
*   **Result:** The unit digit of the entire product is 0.

**Key Points:**

*   Memorize the invariant unit digits (0, 1, 5, 6) and their behavior.
*   For other digits, understand the cyclic nature of their unit digits when raised to powers.
*   For large exponents, only consider the last two digits of the exponent to determine the remainder when divided by the cycle length.
* ## 10.Special Fractions (Product Series) Trick

This trick is for quickly multiplying a series of fractions in a specific pattern, commonly known as a telescoping product. This method significantly reduces the calculation time compared to traditional multiplication.

**How it works (for sums like $ (1 + \frac{1}{n}) $):**

1.  **Simplify each term:** Convert each mixed number or sum within the parentheses into a single fraction.
    *   Example: $ (1 + \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{3}{2} $; $ (1 + \frac{1}{3}) = \frac{4}{3} $; and so on.

2.  **Observe cancellation:** When these simplified fractions are multiplied, a diagonal cancellation pattern emerges. The numerator of one fraction cancels out the denominator of the next.
    *   Example: $ \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} \times \frac{5}{4} \times \frac{6}{5} $
        *   The '3' in $ \frac{3}{2} $ cancels with the '3' in $ \frac{4}{3} $.
        *   The '4' in $ \frac{4}{3} $ cancels with the '4' in $ \frac{5}{4} $.
        *   And so on.

3.  **Identify remaining terms:** After all cancellations, you will be left with the denominator of the first term and the numerator of the last term.

**General Formula (for series like $ (1 + \frac{1}{2}) (1 + \frac{1}{3}) \dots (1 + \frac{1}{n}) $):**

$$ \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 + \frac{1}{3}\right) \dots \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right) = \frac{2+1}{2} \times \frac{3+1}{3} \times \dots \times \frac{n+1}{n} = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} \times \dots \times \frac{n+1}{n} $$
The result will be $ \frac{\text{Numerator of the last term}}{\text{Denominator of the first term}} = \frac{n+1}{2} $.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $ (1 + \frac{1}{2}) (1 + \frac{1}{3}) (1 + \frac{1}{4}) (1 + \frac{1}{5}) $
    *   Simplify each term: $ \frac{3}{2}, \frac{4}{3}, \frac{5}{4}, \frac{6}{5} $
    *   Multiply: $ \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} \times \frac{5}{4} \times \frac{6}{5} $
    *   Cancel terms diagonally: The '3's, '4's, and '5's cancel.
    *   Remaining terms: $ \frac{6}{2} $
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{6}{2} = 3 $

*   **Example 2 (Extended Series from video discussion):**
    *   Problem: $ (1 + \frac{1}{2}) (1 + \frac{1}{3}) (1 + \frac{1}{4}) \dots (1 + \frac{1}{100}) $
    *   Simplify each term: $ \frac{3}{2}, \frac{4}{3}, \dots, \frac{101}{100} $
    *   After cancellation, the remaining terms are the denominator of the first term and the numerator of the last term.
    *   Remaining terms: $ \frac{101}{2} $
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{101}{2} $

**How it works (for differences like $ (1 - \frac{1}{n}) $):**

Similar to the sum series, a cancellation pattern emerges for products of differences.

**General Formula (for series like $ (1 - \frac{1}{2}) (1 - \frac{1}{3}) \dots (1 - \frac{1}{n}) $):**

$$ \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{3}\right) \dots \left(1 - \frac{1}{n}\right) = \frac{2-1}{2} \times \frac{3-1}{3} \times \dots \times \frac{n-1}{n} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \dots \times \frac{n-1}{n} $$
The result will be $ \frac{\text{Numerator of the first term}}{\text{Denominator of the last term}} = \frac{1}{n} $.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $ (1 - \frac{1}{2}) (1 - \frac{1}{3}) (1 - \frac{1}{4}) (1 - \frac{1}{5}) $
    *   Simplify each term: $ \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{5} $
    *   Multiply: $ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{4}{5} $
    *   Cancel terms diagonally: The '2's, '3's, and '4's cancel.
    *   Remaining terms: $ \frac{1}{5} $
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{1}{5} $

*   **Example 4 (Extended Series from video discussion):**
    *   Problem: $ (1 - \frac{1}{2}) (1 - \frac{1}{3}) (1 - \frac{1}{4}) \dots (1 - \frac{1}{800}) $
    *   Simplify each term: $ \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \dots, \frac{799}{800} $
    *   After cancellation, the remaining terms are the numerator of the first term and the denominator of the last term.
    *   Remaining terms: $ \frac{1}{800} $
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{1}{800} $

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is highly effective for series involving consecutive integers in the denominators.
*   The key is to identify the cancellation pattern after simplifying each term.
*   For sums ($1 + \frac{1}{n}$), the denominator of the first term and the numerator of the last term remain.
*   For differences ($1 - \frac{1}{n}$), the numerator of the first term and the denominator of the last term remain.
*   These questions often test your ability to recognize patterns and apply shortcuts quickly.
* ## 11.Odd Digit Verification Trick

The "Odd Digit Verification" trick is a method used to quickly check or find the correct answer in multiple-choice questions, especially in competitive exams, without performing the full calculation. It relies on reducing numbers to a single digit by summing their digits repeatedly. This single digit is sometimes referred to as the digital root or "odd digit" in this context.

**How it works:**

1.  **Reduce all numbers to a single digit:** For each number involved in the calculation (input numbers and answer options), repeatedly add its digits until you get a single digit. This is also known as finding the digital root.
    *   Example: For 17, $1+7 = 8$.
    *   Example: For 15, $1+5 = 6$.
    *   Example: For 255, $2+5+5 = 12 \rightarrow 1+2 = 3$.

2.  **Perform the operation on the single digits:** Apply the required mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, cube, etc.) to these single-digit representations.
    *   Example: If the original problem is $17 \times 15$, and their single digits are 8 and 6, then perform $8 \times 6 = 48$.

3.  **Reduce the result to a single digit:** If the result from step 2 is a multi-digit number, reduce it to a single digit.
    *   Example: $48 \rightarrow 4+8 = 12 \rightarrow 1+2 = 3$.

4.  **Compare with answer options:** Find the answer option whose single-digit representation matches the final single digit from step 3. That option is likely the correct answer.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1 (Multiplication - Area of a Rectangle):**
    *   Problem: The length and breadth of a rectangle field are 17cm and 15cm respectively. Find the area of the rectangular field.

    *   Operation: Total Population = $242533 + 464636 + 138498$.
    *   Single digit for 242533: $2+4+2+5+3+3 = 19 \rightarrow 1+9 = 10 \rightarrow 1+0=1$.

    *   **Result:** Option B (5825505625) matches the single digit 7.

**Key Points:**

*   The Odd Digit Verification trick can be applied to almost any basic arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, powers).
*   It's particularly useful for quickly eliminating incorrect options in multiple-choice questions or verifying your calculated answer.
*   The method works because of the properties of modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 9. The digital root of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9.
*   If multiple answer options have the same single digit, this trick might not uniquely identify the correct answer, and further calculation or other verification methods would be needed. However, it significantly narrows down the possibilities.
*   Practice is key to efficiently applying this trick during exams.
* ## 12.Decimal to Fraction Conversion Trick

This trick is designed for converting recurring decimals (non-terminating, repeating decimals) into fractions quickly. This is particularly useful for competitive exams and topics in rational numbers. The method differs based on whether all decimal places recur or only a portion of them.

**Type 1: All decimal places recur**

This applies when every digit after the decimal point is part of the repeating pattern.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the repeating block:** Note the digits that are repeating after the decimal point.
2.  **Form the numerator:** The repeating block of digits becomes the numerator of the fraction.
3.  **Form the denominator:** For each digit in the repeating block, place a '9' in the denominator. So, if two digits repeat, the denominator is 99; if three digits repeat, it's 999, and so on.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $0.474747...$ (This can be written as $0.\overline{47}$)
    *   Repeating block: 47 (two digits)
    *   Numerator: 47
    *   Denominator: 99
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{47}{99} $

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $0.666...$ (This can be written as $0.\overline{6}$)
    *   Repeating block: 6 (one digit)
    *   Numerator: 6
    *   Denominator: 9
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{6}{9} $ (which can be simplified to $ \frac{2}{3} $)

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $0.123123...$ (This can be written as $0.\overline{123}$)
    *   Repeating block: 123 (three digits)
    *   Numerator: 123
    *   Denominator: 999
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{123}{999} $

**Type 2: Some decimal places don't recur, and some do**

This applies when there are some non-repeating digits immediately after the decimal point, followed by a repeating block. This also covers cases where there is a whole number before the decimal point.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify all digits after the decimal point:** Write down all the digits that appear after the decimal point, including both non-repeating and repeating ones, as a whole number.
2.  **Identify non-repeating digits:** Note the digits that appear immediately after the decimal point but are *not* part of the repeating block.
3.  **Form the numerator:** Subtract the non-repeating digits (from step 2) from the total digits after the decimal (from step 1).
4.  **Form the denominator:**
    *   For each digit in the repeating block, place a '9' in the denominator.
    *   For each non-repeating digit immediately after the decimal point, place a '0' after the '9's.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: $0.3151515...$ (This can be written as $0.3\overline{15}$)
    *   All digits after decimal: 315
    *   Non-repeating digits after decimal: 3
    *   Repeating block: 15 (two digits)
    *   Numerator: $315 - 3 = 312$
    *   Denominator: Two '9's for '15' (99) and one '0' for '3' (0) = 990.
    *   **Result:** $ \frac{312}{990} $

*   **Example 5 (from video discussion):**
    *   Problem: $2.122222...$ (This can be written as $2.1\overline{2}$)
    *   This includes a whole number part. Handle the decimal part first.
    *   All digits after decimal: 12
    *   Non-repeating digits after decimal: 1
    *   Repeating block: 2 (one digit)
    *   Numerator (decimal part): $12 - 1 = 11$
    *   Denominator (decimal part): One '9' for '2' (9) and one '0' for '1' (0) = 90.
    *   Combine with whole number: The whole number '2' is added as $2 \frac{11}{90}$.
    *   **Result:** $2 \frac{11}{90} $ (or $ \frac{180+11}{90} = \frac{191}{90} $)

**Key Points:**

*   This trick bypasses the lengthy algebraic method (multiplying by powers of 10 and subtracting equations) usually taught for these conversions.
*   The placement of '9's and '0's in the denominator is critical and depends directly on the number of repeating and non-repeating digits after the decimal point.
*   Practice with various types of recurring decimals is essential to master this technique.
* ## 13.Surds (Simplification): Model 1 (Multiplication of Surds for a Fixed Number of Times)

This model deals with simplifying expressions where the same surd (square root) is multiplied a specific number of times.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the repeating number:** Determine the number under the square root that is being repeatedly multiplied. Let this be 'x'.
    *   Example: In the expression $\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}$, the repeating number is 2.
    *   Example: In the expression $\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}$, the repeating number is 3.

2.  **Count the repetitions:** Count how many times the surd appears in the expression. Let this be 'n'.
    *   Example: In $\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}$, n = 3 (the surd $\sqrt{2}$ appears 3 times).
    *   Example: In $\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}$, n = 5 (the surd $\sqrt{3}$ appears 5 times).

3.  **Apply the formula:** The simplified value is given by the formula:
    $$ x^{\frac{2^n - 1}{2^n}} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}$
    *   Repeating number (x): 2
    *   Number of repetitions (n): 3
    *   Calculation:
        *   $2^n = 2^3 = 8$
        *   $2^n - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$
        *   Simplified value: $2^{\frac{7}{8}}$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}\sqrt{3}$
    *   Repeating number (x): 3
    *   Number of repetitions (n): 5
    *   Calculation:
        *   $2^n = 2^5 = 32$
        *   $2^n - 1 = 32 - 1 = 31$
        *   Simplified value: $3^{\frac{31}{32}}$

## .Surds (Simplification): Model 2 (Multiplication of Surds to Infinity)

This model addresses the simplification of expressions where the same surd is multiplied infinitely.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the repeating number:** Determine the number under the square root that is being repeatedly multiplied.
    *   Example: In $\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2} \dots \infty$, the repeating number is 2.
    *   Example: In $\sqrt{5}\sqrt{5}\sqrt{5} \dots \infty$, the repeating number is 5.

2.  **Apply the rule:** If a surd is repeatedly multiplied to infinity, the answer is simply the repeating number itself.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2} \dots \infty$
    *   Repeating number: 2
    *   **Result:** 2

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{5}\sqrt{5}\sqrt{5} \dots \infty$
    *   Repeating number: 5
    *   **Result:** 5

## 14.Surds (Simplification): Model 3 (Addition of Surds to Infinity)

This model focuses on simplifying expressions where the same surd is repeatedly added to infinity.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the repeating number:** Determine the number under the square root that is being repeatedly added.
    *   Example: In $\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{6} + \sqrt{6} + \dots \infty$, the repeating number is 6.
    *   Example: In $\sqrt{22} + \sqrt{22} + \sqrt{22} + \dots \infty$, the repeating number is 22.

2.  **Find the next perfect square:** Identify the smallest perfect square number that is greater than the repeating number.
    *   Example: For 6, the next perfect square is 9.
    *   Example: For 22, the next perfect square is 25.

3.  **Take the square root:** The answer is the square root of that perfect square.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{6} + \sqrt{6} + \dots \infty$
    *   Repeating number: 6
    *   Next perfect square greater than 6: 9
    *   **Result:** $\sqrt{9} = 3$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{22} + \sqrt{22} + \sqrt{22} + \dots \infty$
    *   Repeating number: 22
    *   Next perfect square greater than 22: 25
    *   **Result:** $\sqrt{25} = 5$

## Surds (Simplification): Model 4 (Subtraction of Surds to Infinity)

This model addresses the simplification of expressions where the same surd is repeatedly subtracted to infinity.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the repeating number:** Determine the number under the square root that is being repeatedly subtracted.
    *   Example: In $\sqrt{20} - \sqrt{20} - \sqrt{20} - \dots \infty$, the repeating number is 20.
    *   Example: In $\sqrt{47} - \sqrt{47} - \sqrt{47} - \dots \infty$, the repeating number is 47.

2.  **Find the previous perfect square:** Identify the largest perfect square number that is less than the repeating number.
    *   Example: For 20, the previous perfect square is 16.
    *   Example: For 47, the previous perfect square is 36.

3.  **Take the square root:** The answer is the square root of that perfect square.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{20} - \sqrt{20} - \sqrt{20} - \dots \infty$
    *   Repeating number: 20
    *   Previous perfect square less than 20: 16
    *   **Result:** $\sqrt{16} = 4$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{47} - \sqrt{47} - \sqrt{47} - \dots \infty$

    *   **Result:** $\sqrt{36} = 6$

## Surds (Simplification): Model 5 (Nested Surds with Different Values)

This model explains how to simplify nested surds with different values and operations (addition in this case).

**How it works:**

1.  **Work from the innermost surd:** Start simplifying the expression from the innermost square root.
2.  **Calculate the square root:** Find the square root of the number under the innermost surd.
3.  **Add to the next number:** Add the result to the number immediately preceding the surd you just simplified.
4.  **Repeat:** Continue this process of taking the square root and adding it to the next number until you reach the outermost surd.

**Example from the video (with solution):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $\sqrt{45 + \sqrt{13 + \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{19 + \sqrt{36}}}}}}$
    *   **Step 1:** Innermost surd is $\sqrt{36}$.
        *   $\sqrt{36} = 6$
    *   **Step 2:** Add 6 to the next number (19).
        *   $19 + 6 = 25$
    *   **Step 3:** Take the square root of 25.
        *   $\sqrt{25} = 5$
    *   **Step 4:** Add 5 to the next number (20).
        *   $20 + 5 = 25$
    *   **Step 5:** Take the square root of 25.
        *   $\sqrt{25} = 5$
    *   **Step 6:** Add 5 to the next number (4).
        *   $4 + 5 = 9$
    *   **Step 7:** Take the square root of 9.
        *   $\sqrt{9} = 3$
    *   **Step 8:** Add 3 to the next number (13).
        *   $13 + 3 = 16$
    *   **Step 9:** Take the square root of 16.
        *   $\sqrt{16} = 4$
    *   **Step 10:** Add 4 to the outermost number (45).
        *   $45 + 4 = 49$
    *   **Step 11:** Take the square root of 49.
        *   $\sqrt{49} = 7$
    *   **Result:** 7

**Alternative (shortcut) for Model 5:**

If the first operation after the outermost number is addition, find the smallest perfect square number greater than the outermost number, and its square root is the answer.

*   **Example:** For $\sqrt{45 + \sqrt{13 + \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{19 + \sqrt{36}}}}}}$
    *   The outermost number is 45.
    *   The operation immediately after is addition.
    *   The smallest perfect square greater than 45 is 49.
    *   $\sqrt{49} = 7$.
    *   **Result:** 7
    * ## Surds (Addition & Subtraction)

This section focuses on the addition and subtraction of surds (irrational numbers under a root sign). The key principle is that you can only directly add or subtract surds if the number under the root (the radicand) is the same.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Surds:** Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction and whose decimal representation is non-repeating and non-terminating, often appearing under a root sign (e.g., $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{5}$, $\sqrt{7}$).
*   **Like Surds:** Surds with the same radicand (the number inside the square root). For example, $2\sqrt{2}$ and $25\sqrt{2}$ are like surds.
*   **Unlike Surds:** Surds with different radicands. For example, $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$ are unlike surds and cannot be directly added or subtracted.

**Rules for Addition and Subtraction of Surds:**

1.  **If the surds are unlike:** You cannot directly add or subtract them. The expression remains as is (e.g., $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$ remains $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$).
2.  **If the surds are like:** You can add or subtract the coefficients (the numbers outside the root) while keeping the common surd.
    *   Example: $\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2}$ (not $\sqrt{4}$).
    *   Example: $4\sqrt{5} + 2\sqrt{5} = (4+2)\sqrt{5} = 6\sqrt{5}$.

**Simplifying Unlike Surds to Make Them Like Surds:**

When dealing with unlike surds, you often need to simplify them first to see if they can be expressed with the same radicand.

**Method: Prime Factorization (Long Division Method)**

1.  **Break down the number:** Divide the number under the root by its prime factors until you can't divide anymore.
2.  **Look for pairs:** For square roots, group identical prime factors in pairs.
3.  **Extract pairs:** For each pair, take one factor outside the square root.
4.  **Remaining factors:** Any factors that don't form a pair remain inside the square root.

**Example of Prime Factorization (from video for $\sqrt{80}$):**

*   $80 \div 2 = 40$
*   $40 \div 2 = 20$
*   $20 \div 2 = 10$
*   $10 \div 2 = 5$
*   So, $80 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 5 = (2 \times 2) \times (2 \times 2) \times 5$.
*   Therefore, $\sqrt{80} = \sqrt{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 5} = 2 \times 2 \times \sqrt{5} = 4\sqrt{5}$.

**Example of Prime Factorization (from video for $\sqrt{20}$):**

*   $20 \div 2 = 10$
*   $10 \div 2 = 5$
*   So, $20 = 2 \times 2 \times 5$.
*   Therefore, $\sqrt{20} = \sqrt{2 \times 2 \times 5} = 2\sqrt{5}$.

**Shortcut Method for Identifying the Common Radicand:**

This shortcut is useful for quickly determining if surds can be simplified to a common radicand, especially for numbers ending in 0 or 5, or even numbers.

1.  **Focus on the last digit:**
    *   If the number ends in **0 or 5**, the common radicand will likely be $\sqrt{5}$. To find the coefficient, divide the original number by 5 and then take the square root of the quotient.
    *   If the number is **even**, the common radicand will likely be $\sqrt{2}$. To find the coefficient, divide the original number by 2 and then take the square root of the quotient.
    *   If the number is **odd** (and not ending in 5), the common radicand will likely be $\sqrt{3}$. To find the coefficient, divide the original number by 3 and then take the square root of the quotient.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: $\sqrt{80} + \sqrt{20}$**
    *   **Using Shortcut:**
        *   Both 80 and 20 end in 0, suggesting $\sqrt{5}$ as the common radicand.
        *   For $\sqrt{80}$: $80 \div 5 = 16$. $\sqrt{16} = 4$. So, $\sqrt{80} = 4\sqrt{5}$.
        *   For $\sqrt{20}$: $20 \div 5 = 4$. $\sqrt{4} = 2$. So, $\sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}$.
        *   Now, add the like surds: $4\sqrt{5} + 2\sqrt{5} = (4+2)\sqrt{5} = 6\sqrt{5}$.
    *   **Result:** $6\sqrt{5}$

*   **Example 2: $2.64\sqrt{2} + 25\sqrt{2}$ (Note: 2.64 likely meant 64 based on the context of the solution)**
    *   **Using Shortcut (assuming 64):**
        *   Both surds already have $\sqrt{2}$ as the common radicand.
        *   Add the coefficients: $64 + 25 = 89$.
        *   **Result:** $89\sqrt{2}$

*   **Example 3: $\sqrt{75} - \sqrt{27}$**
    *   **Using Shortcut:**
        *   75 ends in 5, suggesting $\sqrt{5}$ but 27 is odd. The common factor is likely 3 as both are divisible by 3. $75/3 = 25$ ($5^2$) and $27/3 = 9$ ($3^2$). So $\sqrt{3}$ is the common radicand.
        *   For $\sqrt{75}$: $75 \div 3 = 25$. $\sqrt{25} = 5$. So, $\sqrt{75} = 5\sqrt{3}$.
        *   For $\sqrt{27}$: $27 \div 3 = 9$. $\sqrt{9} = 3$. So, $\sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}$.
        *   Now, subtract the like surds: $5\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3} = (5-3)\sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}$.
    *   **Result:** $2\sqrt{3}$

*   **Example 4: $\sqrt{32} - \sqrt{18}$**
    *   **Using Shortcut:**
        *   Both 32 and 18 are even, suggesting $\sqrt{2}$ as the common radicand.
        *   For $\sqrt{32}$: $32 \div 2 = 16$. $\sqrt{16} = 4$. So, $\sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$.
        *   For $\sqrt{18}$: $18 \div 2 = 9$. $\sqrt{9} = 3$. So, $\sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$.
        *   Now, subtract the like surds: $4\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2} = (4-3)\sqrt{2} = 1\sqrt{2}$.
    *   **Result:** $\sqrt{2}$
    * ## 15.Ratio and Proportion (Part 1)

This section of the video introduces three key types of proportions that are frequently encountered in ratio and proportion problems.

### Mean Proportion

The mean proportion of two numbers, 'a' and 'b', is the square root of their product.
*   **Given:** Two numbers `a` and `b`.
*   **Formula:** Mean Proportion = $\sqrt{ab}$

**Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:** Mean Proportion of 4 & 9
    *   **Given:** a = 4, b = 9
    *   **Calculation:** $\sqrt{4 \times 9} = \sqrt{36} = 6$
    *   **Result:** 6

### Third Proportion

The third proportion is applicable when given two numbers, 'a' and 'b'.
*   **Given:** Two numbers `a` and `b`.
*   **Formula:** Third Proportion = $\frac{b^2}{a}$

**Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:** Third Proportion of 8 & 12
    *   **Given:** a = 8, b = 12
    *   **Calculation:** $\frac{12^2}{8} = \frac{144}{8} = 18$
    *   **Result:** 18

### Fourth Proportion

The fourth proportion is applicable when given three numbers, 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
*   **Given:** Three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
*   **Formula:** Fourth Proportion = $\frac{bc}{a}$

**Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:** Fourth Proportion of 8, 12 & 18
    *   **Given:** a = 8, b = 12, c = 18
    *   **Calculation:** $\frac{12 \times 18}{8}$.
        *   Simplify by dividing 12 and 8 by 4: $\frac{3 \times 18}{2}$
        *   Simplify by dividing 18 and 2 by 2: $3 \times 9 = 27$
    *   **Result:** 27
    * ## 16.Ratio and Proportion (Part 2)

This section of the video covers advanced methods for calculating ratios when multiple ratios are given, or when ratios are presented in different formats (e.g., multiplication, division, or powers).

### Combining Multiple Ratios (e.g., A:B:C)

This method is used when you are given individual ratios between consecutive variables and need to find the combined ratio of all variables.

**How it works:**

1.  **List the variables:** Write down all the variables involved (e.g., A : B : C).
2.  **Fill in known ratios:** For each given ratio, write the values under the corresponding variables. Leave blank spaces for unknown values in that row.
3.  **Fill blank spaces:** Fill the blank spaces by repeating the nearest existing ratio value in that row.
4.  **Multiply columns:** Multiply the numbers in each column vertically to get the combined ratio.
5.  **Simplify (if possible):** If all numbers in the resulting ratio share a common factor, simplify the ratio by dividing by that factor.

**Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   A : B = 3 : 2
    *   B : C = 5 : 3
    *   Find A : B : C

    *   **Step 1 & 2:**
        A : B : C
        3 : 2 : _
        _ : 5 : 3

    *   **Step 3:**
        A : B : C
        3 : 2 : 2
        5 : 5 : 3

    *   **Step 4:**
        (3 * 5) : (2 * 5) : (2 * 3)
        15 : 10 : 6

    *   **Step 5:** The numbers 15, 10, and 6 do not share a common factor other than 1.
    *   **Result:** A : B : C = 15 : 10 : 6

### Combining Many Ratios for First and Last Term (e.g., A:E)

This method is a shortcut to find the ratio between the very first and very last variable when multiple consecutive ratios are given.

**How it works:**

1.  **Convert to fractions:** Write each given ratio as a fraction (e.g., A:B becomes A/B).
2.  **Multiply all fractions:** Multiply all these fractions together.
3.  **Cancel common terms:** Cancel out any common terms in the numerator and denominator.
4.  **Simplify:** The remaining fraction represents the ratio of the first and last terms.

**Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   A : B = 4 : 3
    *   B : C = 5 : 3
    *   C : D = 3 : 4
    *   D : E = 2 : 5
    *   Find A : E

    *   **Step 1 & 2:**
        A/E = (A/B) * (B/C) * (C/D) * (D/E)
        A/E = (4/3) * (5/3) * (3/4) * (2/5)

    *   **Step 3:** Cancel common terms.
        *   The '3' in A/B's denominator and C/D's numerator cancel.
        *   The '4' in A/B's numerator and C/D's denominator cancel.
        *   The '5' in B/C's numerator and D/E's denominator cancel.
        *   The remaining terms are (1/1) * (1/3) * (1/1) * (2/1) = 2/3.
    *   **Result:** A : E = 2 : 3

### Ratios with Multiplication (e.g., 3A = B = 5C)

This method is used when variables are related by multiplication and equality.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify coefficients:** Note the coefficients of each variable (e.g., for 3A, the coefficient is 3; for B, the coefficient is 1; for 5C, the coefficient is 5).
2.  **Find ratio for each variable:** To find the ratio value for a specific variable, multiply the coefficients of *all other* variables.

**Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   3A = B = 5C
    *   Find A : B : C

    *   **Step 1:** Coefficients are 3 (for A), 1 (for B), and 5 (for C).
    *   **Step 2:**
        *   For A: Multiply coefficients of B and C = 1 * 5 = 5
        *   For B: Multiply coefficients of A and C = 3 * 5 = 15
        *   For C: Multiply coefficients of A and B = 3 * 1 = 3
    *   **Result:** A : B : C = 5 : 15 : 3

### Ratios with Division (e.g., A/10 = B/15 = C/20)

This method is used when variables are related by division and equality.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify denominators:** The ratio values for each variable are simply their respective denominators.
2.  **Simplify (if possible):** If all numbers in the resulting ratio share a common factor, simplify the ratio.

**Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   A/10 = B/15 = C/20
    *   Find A : B : C

    *   **Step 1:** The denominators are 10, 15, and 20.
    *   **Initial Ratio:** A : B : C = 10 : 15 : 20
    *   **Step 2:** All numbers are divisible by 5.
        *   10 ÷ 5 = 2
        *   15 ÷ 5 = 3
        *   20 ÷ 5 = 4
    *   **Result:** A : B : C = 2 : 3 : 4

### Ratios with Powers (e.g., $3^x = 4^y = 12^z$)

This method applies when variables are exponents and the bases are related by multiplication (e.g., $3 \times 4 = 12$).

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify exponents:** The exponents are x, y, and z.
2.  **Apply formula for Z:** The value of Z (the exponent of the product) is calculated as:
    $$ Z = \frac{XY}{X+Y} $$
    Where X and Y are the exponents of the numbers that multiply to form the base of Z.

**Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:**
    *   $3^x = 4^y = 12^z$
    *   Find Z

    *   **Step 1:** Exponents are x, y, and z. Notice that $3 \times 4 = 12$.
    *   **Step 2:** Apply the formula to find z.
        $$ z = \frac{xy}{x+y} $$
    *   **Result:** $z = \frac{xy}{x+y}$
    * ## 17.Conversion of Fractions & Percentages

This section focuses on converting between fractions and percentages, and provides a list of common conversions that are beneficial to memorize for quick calculations.

### Key Concepts

*   **Percentage:** A way to express a number as a fraction of 100. The symbol '%' denotes "per hundred".
    *   Example: $5\% = \frac{5}{100}$
*   **Fraction:** A numerical quantity that is not an integer. It represents a part of a whole.

### Converting Fractions to Percentages

To convert a fraction to a percentage, multiply the fraction by 100.

**Examples from the video:**

1.  **Problem:** Convert $\frac{2}{50}$ to a percentage.
    *   **Calculation:** $\frac{2}{50} \times 100 = 2 \times 2 = 4$
    *   **Result:** $4\%$

2.  **Problem:** Convert $\frac{45}{50}$ to a percentage.
    *   **Calculation:** $\frac{45}{50} \times 100 = 45 \times 2 = 90$
    *   **Result:** $90\%$

### Converting Percentages to Fractions

To convert a percentage to a fraction, divide the percentage by 100.

**Examples from the video:**

1.  **Problem:** Convert $40\%$ to a fraction.
    *   **Calculation:** $\frac{40}{100}$
    *   **Result:** $\frac{2}{5}$

2.  **Problem:** Convert $38\%$ to a fraction.
    *   **Calculation:** $\frac{38}{100}$
    *   **Result:** $\frac{19}{50}$

### Important Fraction and Percentage Equivalents to Memorize

Memorizing these common conversions can significantly speed up calculations, especially in competitive exams.

**Table 1 (from video):**

| Percent     | Fraction |
| :---------- | :------- |
| $8.33\%$    | $1/12$   |
| $10\%$      | $1/10$   |
| $12.5\%$    | $1/8$    |
| $16.6\%$    | $1/6$    |
| $20\%$      | $1/5$    |

**Table 2 (from video):**

| Percent     | Fraction |

| $62.5\%$    | $5/8$    |
| $66.67\%$   | $2/3$    |
| $75\%$      | $3/4$    |
| $80\%$      | $4/5$    |
| $87.5\%$    | $7/8$    |
| $100\%$     | $1$      |

### Tricks for Multiplication using Conversions

When multiplying a decimal percentage with a whole number, converting the percentage to its fractional equivalent can simplify the calculation.

**How it works:**

1.  **Convert to fraction:** Identify the decimal percentage and convert it to its equivalent fraction using the memorized table.
2.  **Multiply with fraction:** Multiply the given whole number by this fraction.
3.  **Perform calculation:** Simplify the multiplication.

**Examples from the video:**

1.  **Problem:** $16.66 \times 36$
    *   **Step 1:** Recognize $16.66\%$ (or $16.6\%$) is equivalent to $\frac{1}{6}$. The problem doesn't have a percentage sign, so we treat it as a decimal value for now, implying the conversion to fraction is the primary simplification.
    *   **Step 2:** $16.66 \times 36 \approx \frac{1}{6} \times 36 \times 100$ (as 16.66 is approx $1/6$ of 100)
    *   **Calculation:** $\frac{1}{6} \times 36 = 6$. The speaker then multiplies by 100 to get 600. The precise conversion is from $16.66\%$ to $1/6$. Since no '%' sign is explicitly mentioned in the problem, one could interpret it as $16.66 \times 36$. However, in the context of "conversion of fractions & percentages", the intent is to use the fractional equivalent of the percentage. If the question implies "$16.66\%$ of 36", then $1/6 \times 36 = 6$. If it implies "$16.66 \times 36$", and we approximate $16.66 \approx 100/6$, then $(100/6) \times 36 = 100 \times 6 = 600$.
    *   **Result:** $600$ (assuming $16.66 \approx 100/6$)

2.  **Problem:** $8.33 \times 24$
    *   **Step 1:** $8.33\%$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{12}$.
    *   **Step 2:** $\frac{1}{12} \times 24 \times 100$ (similar to above, assuming $8.33 \approx 100/12$)
    *   **Calculation:** $\frac{1}{12} \times 24 = 2$. Then $2 \times 100 = 200$.
    *   **Result:** $200$

3.  **Problem:** $12.5 \times 48$
    *   **Step 1:** $12.5\%$ is equivalent to $\frac{1}{8}$.
    *   **Step 2:** $\frac{1}{8} \times 48 \times 100$ (similar assumption)
    *   **Calculation:** $\frac{1}{8} \times 48 = 6$. Then $6 \times 100 = 600$.
    *   **Result:** $600$

4.  **Problem:** $37.5 \times 56$
    *   **Step 1:** $37.5\%$ is equivalent to $\frac{3}{8}$.
    *   **Step 2:** $\frac{3}{8} \times 56 \times 100$ (similar assumption)
    *   **Calculation:** $\frac{3}{8} \times 56 = 3 \times 7 = 21$. Then $21 \times 100 = 2100$.
    *   **Result:** $2100$

**Note on Percentage Sign:** The speaker emphasizes that if there is **no percentage sign** in the problem (e.g., $16.66 \times 36$), you multiply the result by 100 after using the fractional equivalent. If there **is a percentage sign** (e.g., $16.66\% \times 36$), you just use the fractional equivalent directly.
## 18.Analytical Conics: Equation to the Straight Line

This section focuses on finding the equation of a straight line when two points on the line are given. The general form of a straight line equation is $y = mx + c$.

**How it works:**

1.  **Understand the Formula:** The general equation of a straight line is $y = mx + c$, where:
    *   $m$ is the slope (gradient) of the line.
    *   $c$ is the y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y-axis).

2.  **Use the given points:** If you are given two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ that the line passes through, you can set up two equations based on $y = mx + c$:
    *   $y_1 = mx_1 + c$
    *   $y_2 = mx_2 + c$

3.  **Solve for m and c:** You now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns (m and c). You can solve this system to find the values of m and c.
    *   **Method for m:** Subtract the second equation from the first: $(y_1 - y_2) = m(x_1 - x_2)$. This gives you $m = \frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2}$.
    *   **Method for c:** Substitute the value of m back into either of the original equations ($y_1 = mx_1 + c$ or $y_2 = mx_2 + c$) and solve for c.

4.  **Write the Equation:** Once you have the values for m and c, substitute them back into the general equation $y = mx + c$ to get the specific equation of the line.

**Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:** Equation of a straight line passing through (9, 17) and (7, -2).

    *   **Step 1:** Given points are $(x_1, y_1) = (9, 17)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (7, -2)$.
    *   **Step 2:** Set up the equations:
        *   $9m + c = 17$ (Equation 1)
        *   $7m + c = -2$ (Equation 2)

    *   **Step 3:** Solve for m and c.
        *   Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:
            $(9m + c) - (7m + c) = 17 - (-2)$
            $2m = 19$
            $m = \frac{19}{2} = 9.5$

        *   Substitute $m = 9.5$ into Equation 2:
            $7(9.5) + c = -2$
            $66.5 + c = -2$
            $c = -2 - 66.5$
            $c = -68.5$

    *   **Step 4:** Write the equation:
        *   $y = 9.5x - 68.5$

    *   **The speaker also demonstrates an alternative form of the equation:**
        *   $137 = 19x - 2y$ (This form is derived by multiplying the decimals by 2 and rearranging terms, resulting in an integer equation).

**Note:** The speaker mentions that such problems are common in various subjects, including engineering, and emphasizes practicing the method.
## 19.Analytical Conics: Equation to the Straight Line (Model 2)

This section presents a Vedic math-inspired shortcut for finding the equation of a straight line passing through two given points.

**How it works:**

Given two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$:

1.  **Calculate the coefficient of x:** Subtract the y-coordinates: $(y_1 - y_2)$. This will be the coefficient of 'x' in the equation.
2.  **Calculate the coefficient of y:** Subtract the x-coordinates in reverse order: $(x_2 - x_1)$. This will be the coefficient of 'y' in the equation, and it will always be subtracted (i.e., $- (x_2 - x_1)y$).
3.  **Calculate the constant term:** To find the constant on the right side of the equation, multiply the x-coefficient by $x_1$ and subtract the y-coefficient (which is $(x_2 - x_1)$) multiplied by $y_1$. Alternatively, you can calculate $(y_1 - y_2)x_1 - (x_1 - x_2)y_1$.

**Simplified Formula:**

The equation of the straight line passing through $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ can be expressed as:
$$ (y_1 - y_2)x - (x_1 - x_2)y = (y_1 - y_2)x_1 - (x_1 - x_2)y_1 $$

**Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:** Equation of a straight line passing through (8, 12) and (6, -3).

    *   **Step 1: Calculate the coefficient of x ($y_1 - y_2$)**
        *   $12 - (-3) = 12 + 3 = 15$.
        *   So, the x-coefficient is 15.

    *   **Step 2: Calculate the coefficient of y ($x_1 - x_2$)**
        *   $8 - 6 = 2$.
        *   So, the y-coefficient is -2 (since it's always subtracted).

    *   **Step 3: Calculate the constant term ($ (y_1 - y_2)x_1 - (x_1 - x_2)y_1$)**
        *   Using the calculated coefficients and point (8, 12):
        *   $15 \times 8 - 2 \times 12 = 120 - 24 = 96$.

    *   **Step 4: Form the equation:**
        *   $15x - 2y = 96$.

**Another Example from the video:**

1.  **Problem:** Find the equation of a straight line passing through (9, 7) and (-7, 2).

    *   **Step 1: Calculate the coefficient of x ($y_1 - y_2$)**
        *   $7 - 2 = 5$.
        *   So, the x-coefficient is 5.

    *   **Step 2: Calculate the coefficient of y ($x_1 - x_2$)**
        *   $9 - (-7) = 9 + 7 = 16$.
        *   So, the y-coefficient is -16.

    *   **Step 3: Calculate the constant term ($(y_1 - y_2)x_1 - (x_1 - x_2)y_1$)**
        *   Using the calculated coefficients and point (9, 7):
        *   $5 \times 9 - 16 \times 7 = 45 - 112 = -67$.

    *   **Step 4: Form the equation:**
        *   $5x - 16y = -67$.
        * ## 20.Remainder Theorem (Vedic Math Approach)

This section demonstrates a quick method for finding the quotient and remainder when a polynomial is divided by a linear expression, based on Vedic Math principles (specifically the Paravartya Yojana Sutra).

**How it works (Paravartya Yojana Sutra):**

Given a polynomial $P(x)$ to be divided by a linear expression $(x - a)$:

1.  **Change the sign of 'a':** Take the constant 'a' from the divisor $(x - a)$ and change its sign. If the divisor is $(x - 1)$, use $+1$. If it's $(x + 1)$, use $-1$. If it's $(x - 2)$, use $+2$.
2.  **Write down coefficients:** Write down the coefficients of the polynomial $P(x)$ in a row. Make sure to include zero for any missing terms.
3.  **Perform modified synthetic division:**
    *   Bring down the first coefficient.
    *   Multiply the brought-down coefficient by the 'a' (with changed sign) from step 1.
    *   Add the result to the next coefficient in the polynomial.
    *   Repeat the multiplication and addition process until all coefficients have been processed.
4.  **Identify Quotient and Remainder:**
    *   The last number in the final row is the **remainder**.
    *   The preceding numbers are the coefficients of the **quotient**, in descending order of power. The highest power in the quotient will be one less than the highest power in the original polynomial.

**Example 1 from the video:**

*   **Problem:** Divide $7x^2 + 5x + 3$ by $x - 1$.

    *   **Step 1:** Divisor is $(x - 1)$, so 'a' becomes $+1$.
    *   **Step 2:** Coefficients of $7x^2 + 5x + 3$ are 7, 5, 3.

    *   **Step 3: Modified Synthetic Division:**
        ```
        +1 | 7   5   3
           |     7  12
           ----------------
             7  12  15
        ```
        *   Bring down 7.
        *   $7 \times (+1) = 7$. Add to 5: $5 + 7 = 12$.
        *   $12 \times (+1) = 12$. Add to 3: $3 + 12 = 15$.

    *   **Step 4: Quotient and Remainder:**
        *   **Remainder (R):** 15
        *   **Quotient (Q):** $7x + 12$
    *   **Result:** Q = $7x + 12$, R = 15

**Example 2 from the video:**

*   **Problem:** Divide $7x^2 + 5x + 3$ by $x + 1$.

    *   **Step 1:** Divisor is $(x + 1)$, so 'a' becomes $-1$.
    *   **Step 2:** Coefficients of $7x^2 + 5x + 3$ are 7, 5, 3.

    *   **Step 3: Modified Synthetic Division:**
        ```
        -1 | 7   5   3
           |    -7   2
           ----------------
             7  -2   5
        ```
        *   Bring down 7.
        *   $7 \times (-1) = -7$. Add to 5: $5 - 7 = -2$.
        *   $-2 \times (-1) = 2$. Add to 3: $3 + 2 = 5$.

    *   **Step 4: Quotient and Remainder:**
        *   **Remainder (R):** 5
        *   **Quotient (Q):** $7x - 2$
    *   **Result:** Q = $7x - 2$, R = 5

**Example 3 from the video:**

*   **Problem:** Divide $x^3 + 7x^2 + 6x + 5$ by $x - 2$.

    *   **Step 1:** Divisor is $(x - 2)$, so 'a' becomes $+2$.
    *   **Step 2:** Coefficients of $x^3 + 7x^2 + 6x + 5$ are 1, 7, 6, 5.

    *   **Step 3: Modified Synthetic Division:**
        ```
        +2 | 1   7   6   5
           |     2  18  48
           ------------------
             1   9  24  53
        ```
        *   Bring down 1.
        *   $1 \times (+2) = 2$. Add to 7: $7 + 2 = 9$.
        *   $9 \times (+2) = 18$. Add to 6: $6 + 18 = 24$.
        *   $24 \times (+2) = 48$. Add to 5: $5 + 48 = 53$.

    *   **Step 4: Quotient and Remainder:**
        *   **Remainder (R):** 53
        *   **Quotient (Q):** $x^2 + 9x + 24$
    *   **Result:** Q = $x^2 + 9x + 24$, R = 53
* ## 21.Purnapurnabhyam

Purnapurnabhyam is a Vedic mathematics sutra (formula) used for factoring algebraic expressions, particularly those that resemble the expanded form of a perfect cube, like $(a+b)^3$ or $(a-b)^3$. The word "Purnapurnabhyam" means "by the completion or non-completion".

**Concept:**

The method involves transforming a given polynomial into a form where it can be recognized as a perfect cube, plus or minus a remainder. This allows for easier factorization and finding the roots of the equation.

**Application:**

This technique is primarily used in solving for the roots of quadratic equations and higher-degree polynomials. By recognizing a polynomial as a near-perfect cube, one can simplify the expression and find its factors.

**How it works (illustrated with an example from the video):**

Consider the equation:
$x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 = 0$

1.  **Identify a potential perfect cube:** The coefficients $x^3$ and $6x^2$ suggest a possible expansion of $(x+2)^3$.
    *   Expand $(x+2)^3$:
        $(x+2)^3 = x^3 + 3(x^2)(2) + 3(x)(2^2) + 2^3$
        $(x+2)^3 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8$

2.  **Compare and adjust:** Compare the expanded form of $(x+2)^3$ with the original equation:
    *   Original: $x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6$
    *   $(x+2)^3$: $x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8$

    To make the original equation match $(x+2)^3$, we need to add 'x' and '2' to the original equation:
    *   $x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 + (x+2) = x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8$
    *   So, $x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 + (x+2) = (x+2)^3$

3.  **Rewrite the equation:** Since the original equation is equal to zero:
    *   $x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 = 0$
    *   We can rewrite this as: $(x+2)^3 - (x+2) = 0$

4.  **Substitute for simplification:** Let $a = x+2$.
    *   The equation becomes: $a^3 - a = 0$

5.  **Solve for 'a':**
    *   $a(a^2 - 1) = 0$
    *   $a(a-1)(a+1) = 0$
    *   Therefore, the possible values for 'a' are $0, 1, -1$.

6.  **Solve for 'x':** Substitute back $x+2$ for 'a':
    *   If $a = 0 \implies x+2 = 0 \implies x = -2$
    *   If $a = 1 \implies x+2 = 1 \implies x = -1$
    *   If $a = -1 \implies x+2 = -1 \implies x = -3$

**Result:**
The values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 = 0$ are $-2, -1, -3$.

**Key Points:**

*   Purnapurnabhyam focuses on "completing" the algebraic expression to form a recognizable identity.
*   It requires familiarity with algebraic identities like $(a+b)^3$.
*   This method can be more efficient than traditional factorization methods for certain types of polynomials, especially in competitive exams.
# 22. Vyashtisamanstih part 1

This problem involves understanding how ratios of ages change over time. The key principle is that while the *difference* in ages remains constant, the *ratio* of ages changes as both individuals age. Specifically, as time passes, the ratio of the older person's age to the younger person's age will decrease and approach 1.

**Problem Statement:**

The ratio of the age of a man and his sister in 1982 is 5:4. In 1962, what cannot be the ratio of their age?

**Given Options:**

a) 7:5
b) 4:3
c) 6:5
d) 12:10

**Solution Breakdown:**

1.  **Understand the Time Difference:**
    The ratio is given for 1982, and we need to find what *cannot* be the ratio in 1962. This means we are looking back 20 years (1982 - 1962 = 20 years).

2.  **Initial Ratio in 1982:**
    Let the man's age in 1982 be $5x$ and his sister's age in 1982 be $4x$.
    The ratio $\frac{5x}{4x} = 1.25$.

3.  **Ages in 1962:**
    Since 1962 is 20 years before 1982, their ages in 1962 would have been:
    Man's age: $5x - 20$
    Sister's age: $4x - 20$

4.  **Ratio in 1962:**
    The ratio of their ages in 1962 would be $\frac{5x - 20}{4x - 20}$.

5.  **Analyze how ratios change with age:**
    As people get older, the difference in their ages becomes a smaller proportion of their actual ages. This means the ratio of their ages will get closer to 1. For instance, if a ratio is 5:4 (1.25), 20 years prior, the difference in their ages would have been more significant relative to their individual ages, resulting in a higher ratio (further from 1). Conversely, 20 years later, the ratio would be closer to 1.

6.  **Evaluate the options (using the ratio value):**
    We need to find the option that represents a ratio *lower* than 1.25, as going back in time should result in a *higher* ratio (further from 1).

    *   **a) 7:5**
        $\frac{7}{5} = 1.40$

    *   **b) 4:3**
        $\frac{4}{3} \approx 1.33$

    *   **c) 6:5**
        $\frac{6}{5} = 1.20$

    *   **d) 12:10**
        $\frac{12}{10} = 1.20$
        (This simplifies to 6:5)

7.  **Identify the impossible ratio:**
    Since 1962 is *before* 1982, the ratio of their ages in 1962 must be *greater* than the ratio in 1982 (1.25).
    Options a and b (1.40 and 1.33) are both greater than 1.25, so these are possible ratios.
    Options c and d (both 1.20) are *less* than 1.25. This means that 20 years earlier, their age ratio would have been closer to 1, which is impossible because as ages decrease, the relative difference in ages becomes more pronounced, moving the ratio *further* from 1.

Therefore, a ratio of 6:5 (or 12:10) cannot be the ratio of their ages in 1962.

**The final answer is $\boxed{\text{c) 6:5}}$**
## 23. Vyashtisamanstih part 2
 Math Trick: Multiplication by 11, 111, 1111, etc.

This video demonstrates a Vedic Math trick called "Vyashthisamansthith" (Part and Whole) for quickly multiplying any number by numbers consisting solely of ones (e.g., 11, 111, 1111). This method is presented as a valuable shortcut for competitive exams and various algebraic calculations.

The trick relies on a simple pattern of adding adjacent digits and carrying over when necessary. The general approach involves placing the digits of the original number and then inserting sums of adjacent digits between them.

**How it works (General Steps):**

1.  **Identify the Multiplier:** Determine the number of '1's in the multiplier (e.g., 11 has two '1's, 111 has three '1's). Let this be 'n'.

2.  **Pad the Original Number:** Add `(n-1)` zeros to both the left and right of the original number. This creates a padded number.

3.  **Sum Digits in Groups of 'n':**
    *   Start from the rightmost digit of the padded number.
    *   For each position, sum 'n' consecutive digits (starting from the current position and moving left).
    *   Write down the unit digit of the sum.
    *   Carry over any tens digit to the next sum on the left.

4.  **Repeat until all digits are processed:** Continue this process until you have moved across the entire padded number.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

### 1. Multiplication by 11 (n=2)

**Example: $35 \times 11$**

1.  **Pad the number:** Add one zero to each side of 35: `0350`.
2.  **Sum digits in groups of 2:**
    *   Rightmost: $0 + 5 = 5$. Write down `5`.
    *   Next: $5 + 3 = 8$. Write down `8`.
    *   Next: $3 + 0 = 3$. Write down `3`.

    **Result:** $385$

### 2. Multiplication by 111 (n=3)

**Example: $142 \times 111$**

1.  **Pad the number:** Add two zeros to each side of 142: `0014200`.
2.  **Sum digits in groups of 3:**
    *   Rightmost: $0 + 0 + 2 = 2$. Write down `2`.
    *   Next: $0 + 2 + 4 = 6$. Write down `6`.
    *   Next: $2 + 4 + 1 = 7$. Write down `7`.
    *   Next: $4 + 1 + 0 = 5$. Write down `5`.
    *   Next: $1 + 0 + 0 = 1$. Write down `1`.

    **Result:** $15762$

### 3. Multiplication by 1111 (n=4)

**Example: $2132 \times 1111$**

1.  **Pad the number:** Add three zeros to each side of 2132: `0002132000`.
2.  **Sum digits in groups of 4:**
    *   Rightmost: $0 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 2$. Write down `2`.
    *   Next: $0 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 5$. Write down `5`.
    *   Next: $0 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 6$. Write down `6`.
    *   Next: $2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 8$. Write down `8`.
    *   Next: $3 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 6$. Write down `6`.
    *   Next: $1 + 2 + 0 + 0 = 3$. Write down `3`.
    *   Next: $2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2$. Write down `2`.

    **Result:** $2368652$

**Key Points:**

*   This Vedic Math trick provides a very fast way to perform these specific multiplications mentally or with minimal writing.
*   The number of zeros added to each side of the original number is always one less than the number of '1's in the multiplier.
*   The sums of digits are always taken in groups equal to the number of '1's in the multiplier.
*   This method can be extended to any number of '1's in the multiplier (e.g., 11111, 111111, etc.).
## 24. Vyashtisamanstih part 3
* This video introduces a Vedic Math technique for factoring algebraic cubic polynomials of the form $x^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8 = 0$. The method, referred to as "Vyashthisamansthith" (Part and Whole), aims to simplify the factorization process by relating the given polynomial to a known cubic expansion and then factoring the remaining quadratic expression.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify a potential factor using the constant term:**
    *   Observe the constant term of the polynomial, which is 8 in this case.
    *   Consider the factors of 8. The video suggests trying an expression like $(x+a)^3$.
    *   Since the constant term is 8, the video hints at using $(x+2)^3$ because $2^3 = 8$. However, the presenter later uses $(x+3)^3$ as an example for demonstration. Let's follow the presenter's demonstration of using $(x+3)^3$ and then explain how to find the correct factor.

2.  **Expand a suitable cubic expression:**
    *   The presenter initially demonstrates with $(x+3)^3$.
    *   Recall the expansion of $(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$.
    *   So, $(x+3)^3 = x^3 + 3(x^2)(3) + 3(x)(3^2) + 3^3 = x^3 + 9x^2 + 27x + 27$.

3.  **Find the difference between the given polynomial and the expanded cubic:**
    *   Given polynomial: $P(x) = x^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8$
    *   Expanded cubic: $E(x) = x^3 + 9x^2 + 27x + 27$
    *   Subtract $P(x)$ from $E(x)$ to find the "adjustment" needed.
        $(x^3 + 9x^2 + 27x + 27) - (x^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8) = (9-7)x^2 + (27-14)x + (27-8) = 2x^2 + 13x + 19$.

4.  **Factor the resulting quadratic expression (if possible):**
    *   The remaining expression is $2x^2 + 13x + 19$.
    *   The presenter attempts to factor this quadratic into two binomials: $(x \ \ \ \ )(2x \ \ \ \ )$.
    *   They look for numbers that multiply to 19 (the constant term) and, when cross-multiplied and added, give 13 (the coefficient of x).
    *   The presenter tries $(x+3)(2x+7)$.
        *   Multiplying the constant terms: $3 \times 7 = 21$.
        *   Cross-multiplication: $x \times 7 = 7x$ and $3 \times 2x = 6x$. Adding them: $7x + 6x = 13x$.
    *   The constant term obtained is 21, but we need 19. So, we adjust by subtracting 2: $(x+3)(2x+7) - 2$.
    *   This implies that the original polynomial can be written as $(x+3)^3 - (2x^2 + 13x + 19)$.
    *   However, this approach demonstrated in the video does not directly lead to the factorization of the original cubic polynomial $x^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8 = 0$.

**Corrected Vedic Math approach (using Factor Theorem as initial step, as suggested by other sources):**

A more common Vedic Math approach for cubic factorization involves finding one root by inspection (trial and error) and then using algebraic division or synthetic division to reduce the cubic to a quadratic equation.

1.  **Find a root by inspection (Factor Theorem):**
    *   Check factors of the constant term (8): $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 8$.
    *   Let $P(x) = x^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8$.
    *   Try $x = -1$:
        $P(-1) = (-1)^3 + 7(-1)^2 + 14(-1) + 8 = -1 + 7 - 14 + 8 = 0$.
    *   Since $P(-1) = 0$, $(x+1)$ is a factor of the polynomial.

2.  **Perform polynomial division (or synthetic division) by $(x+1)$:**
    *   Dividing $x^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8$ by $(x+1)$ gives the quadratic quotient $x^2 + 6x + 8$.

3.  **Factor the resulting quadratic equation:**
    *   Factor $x^2 + 6x + 8$. We need two numbers that multiply to 8 and add to 6. These are 2 and 4.
    *   So, $x^2 + 6x + 8 = (x+2)(x+4)$.

4.  **Combine the factors:**
    *   Therefore, the factorization of $x^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8 = 0$ is $(x+1)(x+2)(x+4) = 0$.

**Final Answer for Factorization:**

The factors of the polynomial $x^3 + 7x^2 + 14x + 8$ are $(x+1)(x+2)(x+4)$.
## 25.Apollonius Theorem

Appolonius Theorem describes a fundamental relationship between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the length of a median to one of its sides. A median is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

**Statement of the Theorem:**

In a triangle ABC, if AD is a median to side BC (meaning D is the midpoint of BC), then:
$$ AB^2 + AC^2 = 2(AD^2 + BD^2) $$

**Explanation of the terms:**

*   $AB^2$: The square of the length of side AB.
*   $AC^2$: The square of the length of side AC.
*   $AD^2$: The square of the length of the median AD.
*   $BD^2$: The square of the length of segment BD (which is half the length of BC). Since D is the midpoint of BC, $BD = CD$.

**How it works (as explained in the video):**

The video's presenter highlights the importance of Apollonius Theorem in understanding properties of triangles, especially in "proof-based questions" common in 8th, 9th, and 10th-grade mathematics. It emphasizes that triangles are fundamental shapes used in various real-world applications, such as calculating the area of land or houses.

The core idea conveyed is that the sum of the squares of two sides of a triangle (AB and AC) is equal to twice the sum of the square of the median to the third side (AD) and the square of half of the third side (BD).

**Key Points:**

*   Appolonius Theorem applies specifically to a triangle and its median.
*   It establishes a relationship between the lengths of the sides and the median.
*   This theorem is crucial for solving geometry problems that involve medians and side lengths, particularly those requiring proofs.
*   The video notes that this theorem is not as widely taught in modern curricula but was more prominent in ancient mathematical studies.
*   Understanding this theorem can provide valuable "tricks" or shortcuts for solving complex problems involving congruent and similar triangles.

**Visual Representation (from the video):**

The video displays a triangle labeled A, B, E with a line segment AD. Another point C is located between D and E. The provided formula, $2(AD^2 + BD^2) = AB^2 + AC^2$, is directly from Apollonius Theorem. The presenter incorrectly states that the theorem cannot be applied to the triangle ABC (implying AC as a median) because D is not the midpoint. However, the formula *is* a direct application of Apollonius Theorem if AD is indeed a median to BC. The presenter then draws a new, simplified triangle where a median clearly divides a side into two equal halves to correctly illustrate the application of the theorem. This new diagram reinforces the condition that the line segment from the vertex to the base must bisect the base for the theorem to apply.

The video emphasizes that if a line segment from a vertex *bisects* the opposite side, then Apollonius Theorem can be applied to relate the squares of the other two sides to the square of the median and the square of half of the bisected side.
This video introduces a Vedic Math trick under the "Sunyam Samya Samuchyah" (Model 6) category, which provides a shortcut for solving specific types of algebraic equations involving fractions. The trick is particularly useful for competitive exams where time is a critical factor.

**Pattern Identification:**

The trick applies to equations where:
*   Fractions are added on both sides of the equality.
*   Each numerator is exactly one less than its corresponding denominator's constant term.
    *   For example, in a term like $\frac{x-a}{x-b}$, 'a' must be 'b-1'.

**How it Works (General Steps):**

1.  **Recognize the Pattern:** Observe if the numerator's constant term is one less than the denominator's constant term for all fractions in the equation.
    *   If you have $\frac{x-c_1}{x-d_1} + \frac{x-c_2}{x-d_2} = \frac{x-c_3}{x-d_3} + \frac{x-c_4}{x-d_4}$
    *   The pattern requires $c_1 = d_1 - 1$, $c_2 = d_2 - 1$, $c_3 = d_3 - 1$, $c_4 = d_4 - 1$.

2.  **Rewrite the fractions:** Convert each fraction $\frac{x-C}{x-D}$ to $\frac{1}{x-D}$ by adjusting the numerator.
    *   This is achieved by rewriting $x-C$ as $(x-D) + (D-C)$. Since $C = D-1$, then $D-C = 1$.
    *   So, $\frac{x-(D-1)}{x-D} = \frac{(x-D)+1}{x-D} = 1 + \frac{1}{x-D}$.
    *   The video skips this step directly to $\frac{1}{x-D}$ implying that the '1's on both sides cancel out when the equation is fully written in this form.

3.  **Form pairs and sum denominator constants:**
    *   After converting, identify pairs of denominators (one from each side of the original equation). The presenter demonstrates pairing the first denominator from the left side with the first from the right side, and similarly for the second pair.
    *   Sum the constant terms of the denominators within each pair.
        *   For example, if you pair $(x-d_1)$ and $(x-d_3)$, sum $d_1 + d_3$.
        *   If you pair $(x-d_2)$ and $(x-d_4)$, sum $d_2 + d_4$.

4.  **Equate the sums to zero (or other relationships):**
    *   The video shows that if the sum of the constants from the denominators on one side equals the sum of the constants from the denominators on the other side, then a simple equation can be formed.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

### Example 1: $\frac{x-3}{x-4} + \frac{x-4}{x-5} = \frac{x-2}{x-3} + \frac{x-5}{x-6}$

1.  **Check the pattern:**
    *   For $\frac{x-3}{x-4}$: $3 = 4-1$ (True)
    *   For $\frac{x-4}{x-5}$: $4 = 5-1$ (True)
    *   For $\frac{x-2}{x-3}$: $2 = 3-1$ (True)
    *   For $\frac{x-5}{x-6}$: $5 = 6-1$ (True)
    *   The pattern holds.

2.  **Rewrite (as implied by the trick):**
    *   The equation can be seen as:
        $1 + \frac{1}{x-4} + 1 + \frac{1}{x-5} = 1 + \frac{1}{x-3} + 1 + \frac{1}{x-6}$
    *   The '1's would cancel out, leaving:
        $\frac{1}{x-4} + \frac{1}{x-5} = \frac{1}{x-3} + \frac{1}{x-6}$

3.  **Sum denominator constants and variables (as demonstrated):**
    *   Left side denominators: $(x-4)$ and $(x-5)$. Sum of constants is $(-4) + (-5) = -9$. Sum of x terms is $x+x = 2x$.
        So, $2x - 9$.
    *   Right side denominators: $(x-3)$ and $(x-6)$. Sum of constants is $(-3) + (-6) = -9$. Sum of x terms is $x+x = 2x$.
        So, $2x - 9$.

4.  **Equate the sums:**
    *   Since both sides result in $2x - 9$, set this to zero (as often happens in Vedic Math with balanced equations).
    *   $2x - 9 = 0$
    *   $2x = 9$
    *   $x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5$

### Example 2: $\frac{2x-3}{2x-4} + \frac{x-4}{x-5} = \frac{2x-6}{2x-7} + \frac{x-1}{x-2}$

1.  **Check the pattern:**
    *   For $\frac{2x-3}{2x-4}$: $3 = 4-1$ (True)
    *   For $\frac{x-4}{x-5}$: $4 = 5-1$ (True)
    *   For $\frac{2x-6}{2x-7}$: $6 = 7-1$ (True)
    *   For $\frac{x-1}{x-2}$: $1 = 2-1$ (True)
    *   The pattern holds.

2.  **Rewrite (as implied by the trick):**
    *   The equation can be seen as:
        $1 + \frac{1}{2x-4} + 1 + \frac{1}{x-5} = 1 + \frac{1}{2x-7} + 1 + \frac{1}{x-2}$
    *   The '1's would cancel out, leaving:
        $\frac{1}{2x-4} + \frac{1}{x-5} = \frac{1}{2x-7} + \frac{1}{x-2}$

3.  **Sum denominator constants and variables (as demonstrated):**
    *   Left side denominators: $(2x-4)$ and $(x-5)$. Sum of constants is $(-4) + (-5) = -9$. Sum of x terms is $2x+x = 3x$.
        So, $3x - 9$.
    *   Right side denominators: $(2x-7)$ and $(x-2)$. Sum of constants is $(-7) + (-2) = -9$. Sum of x terms is $2x+x = 3x$.
        So, $3x - 9$.

4.  **Equate the sums:**
    *   Since both sides result in $3x - 9$, set this to zero.
    *   $3x - 9 = 0$
    *   $3x = 9$
    *   $x = \frac{9}{3} = 3$

**Key Points:**

*   This Vedic Math trick significantly reduces the algebraic manipulation required for these specific types of fractional equations.
*   The core idea is that when the numerator's constant is one less than the denominator's constant, the fraction can be simplified (effectively leading to a cancellation of '1's on both sides of the equation).
*   The trick then relies on summing the variable and constant terms of the denominators on each side, which should be equal when the pattern is met.
*   This simplified sum is then equated to zero to find the value of x.
* I can help you with that! The video you provided demonstrates a Vedic Math trick under the "Sunyam Samya Samuchyah" (Model 7) category for solving specific types of algebraic equations involving fractions.

Here's the extracted data in the requested format:

## 26.Sunyam Samya Samuchyah (Model 7)

This Vedic Math trick is designed to quickly solve algebraic equations with fractions that follow a particular pattern. The method aims to simplify the equation by making the numerators uniform and then solving the resulting linear equation.

**How it works (General Steps):**

1.  **Identify the Pattern:** The trick applies when the coefficients of 'x' in the numerator and denominator are related in a specific way, and the constant terms also follow a pattern.
    *   For a fraction $\frac{A}{Bx+C}$, the pattern is when the ratio of the numerator to the coefficient of 'x' in the denominator is consistent, and this consistency allows for simplification.

2.  **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the Numerators:** Calculate the LCM of all the numerators in the equation. This LCM will be the target value to which all numerators will be adjusted.

3.  **Adjust Each Fraction:** For each term, multiply both the numerator and the denominator by a factor that makes the numerator equal to the LCM found in step 2.

4.  **Form Pairs and Equate Denominator Sums:**
    *   Once all numerators are equal to the LCM, you can effectively "cancel" them out (or divide the entire equation by the LCM).
    *   Then, you will be left with an equation where the denominators are summed in a specific pattern. The presenter suggests grouping the denominators from the left side and the denominators from the right side and summing them.
    *   Equate these sums to zero to find the value of 'x'.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

### Example 1: $\frac{2}{2x+6} + \frac{3}{x+1} = \frac{4}{4x+8} + \frac{6}{2x+8}$

1.  **Identify Numerators and find LCM:**
    *   Numerators are 2, 3, 4, 6.
    *   LCM of (2, 3, 4, 6) is 12.

2.  **Adjust Each Fraction to have a numerator of 12:**
    *   For $\frac{2}{2x+6}$: Multiply numerator and denominator by 6.
        $\frac{2 \times 6}{(2x+6) \times 6} = \frac{12}{12x+36}$
    *   For $\frac{3}{x+1}$: Multiply numerator and denominator by 4.
        $\frac{3 \times 4}{(x+1) \times 4} = \frac{12}{4x+4}$
    *   For $\frac{4}{4x+8}$: Multiply numerator and denominator by 3.
        $\frac{4 \times 3}{(4x+8) \times 3} = \frac{12}{12x+24}$
    *   For $\frac{6}{2x+8}$: Multiply numerator and denominator by 2.
        $\frac{6 \times 2}{(2x+8) \times 2} = \frac{12}{4x+16}$

3.  **Rewrite the equation with adjusted fractions:**
    $\frac{12}{12x+36} + \frac{12}{4x+4} = \frac{12}{12x+24} + \frac{12}{4x+16}$

4.  **Cancel numerators and sum denominators:**
    *   Effectively, remove the numerators (divide by 12).
    *   Sum the current denominators on the left side: $(12x+36) + (4x+4) = 16x + 40$.
    *   Sum the current denominators on the right side: $(12x+24) + (4x+16) = 16x + 40$.

5.  **Equate the sums and solve for x:**
    *   $16x + 40 = 0$
    *   $16x = -40$
    *   $x = -\frac{40}{16}$
    *   $x = -\frac{5}{2}$ or $-2.5$

### Example 2: $\frac{4}{3x+8} + \frac{2}{x+1} = \frac{6}{x-1} + \frac{4}{x+4}$

1.  **Identify Numerators and find LCM:**
    *   Numerators are 4, 2, 6, 4.
    *   LCM of (4, 2, 6, 4) is 12.

2.  **Adjust Each Fraction to have a numerator of 12:**
    *   For $\frac{4}{3x+8}$: Multiply numerator and denominator by 3.
        $\frac{4 \times 3}{(3x+8) \times 3} = \frac{12}{9x+24}$
    *   For $\frac{2}{x+1}$: Multiply numerator and denominator by 6.
        $\frac{2 \times 6}{(x+1) \times 6} = \frac{12}{6x+6}$
    *   For $\frac{6}{x-1}$: Multiply numerator and denominator by 2.
        $\frac{6 \times 2}{(x-1) \times 2} = \frac{12}{2x-2}$
    *   For $\frac{4}{x+4}$: Multiply numerator and denominator by 3.
        $\frac{4 \times 3}{(x+4) \times 3} = \frac{12}{3x+12}$

3.  **Rewrite the equation with adjusted fractions:**
    $\frac{12}{9x+24} + \frac{12}{6x+6} = \frac{12}{2x-2} + \frac{12}{3x+12}$

4.  **Cancel numerators and sum denominators:**
    *   Effectively, remove the numerators (divide by 12).
    *   Sum the current denominators on the left side: $(9x+24) + (6x+6) = 15x + 30$.
    *   Sum the current denominators on the right side: $(2x-2) + (3x+12) = 5x + 10$.

5.  **Equate the sums and solve for x:**
    *   $15x + 30 = 5x + 10$
    *   $15x - 5x = 10 - 30$
    *   $10x = -20$
    *   $x = -2$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is a powerful tool for quickly solving specific types of fractional algebraic equations that appear in competitive exams.
*   The essential step is to make all numerators equal to their LCM, which then allows for a simplified equation based on the denominators.
*   The pattern of constant terms and coefficients might seem complex initially, but with practice, identifying it becomes faster.
*   The method ultimately simplifies complex fractional equations into a linear equation, which is straightforward to solve.
* I can help you with that! The video you provided demonstrates a Vedic Math trick under the "Sunyam Samya Samuchyah" (Model 8) category, which provides a shortcut for solving specific types of algebraic equations involving cubic expressions or ratios of linear terms.

Here's the extracted data in the requested format:

## 27.Sunyam Samya Samuchyah (Model 8)

This Vedic Math trick is designed to quickly solve algebraic equations that follow specific patterns involving cubic expressions or ratios of linear terms. The method aims to simplify these equations, often by eliminating the cubic powers or by recognizing balanced sums in linear forms.

**How it works (General Steps):**

The video presents two main types of patterns within this model:

### Type 1: Sum of Cubes (or difference) on one side, and a multiple of a cubic on the other side.

**Pattern:** $(x-A)^3 + (x-B)^3 = k(x-C)^3$

**Conditions for the Trick:**
*   All terms are cubic.
*   The terms can be simplified by taking the cube root on both sides (effectively "canceling" the cubes).
*   The constants in the simplified linear expressions (after removing cubes) are balanced such that summing them leads to a linear equation that can be easily solved.

**Steps:**

1.  **Cancel the Cubes:** If all terms in the equation are raised to the power of 3, and there's no other operation preventing it, remove the cubic power from all terms.
    *   $(x-A)^3 + (x-B)^3 = k(x-C)^3$ becomes $(x-A) + (x-B) = \sqrt{k}(x-C)$

2.  **Simplify the Linear Equation:** Combine like terms on both sides of the simplified linear equation.

3.  **Solve for x:** Isolate 'x' to find the solution.

**Example from the video (with solution):**

### Example 1: $(x-4)^3 + (x-8)^3 = 2(x-6)^3$

1.  **Cancel the cubes:** Remove the cubic power from all terms and take the cube root of 2.
    *   This is where the presenter *implicitly* assumes $\sqrt{2}$ is either negligible or that the problem is designed for a simpler linear equation after this step. In the video, the '2' is retained on the right side as a multiplier for the linear term.
    *   $(x-4) + (x-8) = 2(x-6)$

2.  **Simplify the linear equation:**
    *   Left side: $(x-4) + (x-8) = 2x - 12$
    *   Right side: $2(x-6) = 2x - 12$

3.  **Equate the simplified expressions:**
    *   $2x - 12 = 2x - 12$
    *   This equation is an identity, meaning it's true for all values of x. However, in the context of Vedic Math shortcuts for specific problems, this often implies that the original problem is constructed to yield a direct solution from a related linear equation. The presenter sets one side to zero to find the value of x.
    *   $2x - 12 = 0$
    *   $2x = 12$
    *   $x = \frac{12}{2} = 6$

### Example 2: $(2x+1)^3 + (x-7)^3 = 2(x-2)^3$

1.  **Cancel the cubes:** Remove the cubic power from all terms.
    *   $(2x+1) + (x-7) = 2(x-2)$

2.  **Simplify the linear equation:**
    *   Left side: $(2x+1) + (x-7) = 3x - 6$
    *   Right side: $2(x-2) = 2x - 4$

3.  **Equate the simplified expressions and solve for x:**
    *   $3x - 6 = 2x - 4$
    *   $3x - 2x = -4 + 6$
    *   $x = 2$

### Type 2: Ratios of Linear Terms (derived from cubics)

**Pattern:** $\frac{(x+A)^3}{(x+B)^3} = \frac{x+C}{x+D}$

**Conditions for the Trick:**
*   Cubic terms appear on one side as a ratio.
*   The other side consists of a ratio of linear terms.
*   The constants in the expressions on both sides are balanced in a specific way.

**Steps:**

1.  **Cancel the Cubes:** Remove the cubic power from the left side of the equation.
    *   $\frac{x+A}{x+B} = \frac{x+C}{x+D}$

2.  **Cross-Multiply and Simplify (Implicit in Vedic Math):**
    *   The presenter then looks for a "pair" by summing constants: $A+B$ on the left side and $C+D$ on the right side.
    *   If these sums are equal ($A+B = C+D$), then the solution can be found by setting a related linear expression to zero.
    *   Alternatively, summing the numerator and denominator of each fraction: $(x+A) + (x+B)$ and $(x+C) + (x+D)$.

**Example from the video (with solution):**

### Example 3: $\frac{(x+4)^3}{(x+6)^3} = \frac{x+2}{x+8}$

1.  **Cancel the cubes:**
    *   $\frac{x+4}{x+6} = \frac{x+2}{x+8}$

2.  **Sum constants from numerators and denominators as pairs:**
    *   Left side (numerator + denominator constants): $4+6 = 10$.
    *   Right side (numerator + denominator constants): $2+8 = 10$.
    *   Since the sums are equal, a linear equation can be formed by summing the numerators and denominators:
        $(x+4) + (x+6) = (x+2) + (x+8)$
        $2x + 10 = 2x + 10$
    *   Similar to Example 1, the presenter states that the "pair" is $2x+10$. Setting this to zero:
    *   $2x+10 = 0$
    *   $2x = -10$
    *   $x = \frac{-10}{2} = -5$

**Key Points:**

*   This Vedic Math model provides rapid solutions for specific algebraic equations that exhibit these balancing patterns.
*   The initial step of canceling cubic powers is a significant shortcut.
*   The core of the trick lies in recognizing when the sums of constants (or simplified linear expressions) are equal, allowing for direct calculation of 'x'.
*   The video emphasizes that consistent practice with these patterns is essential for mastering the technique.
* I can help you with that! The video you provided focuses on a Vedic Math technique called "Gunita Samuchyah: Samuchya Gunitah," which is used for verifying the correctness of answers in various mathematical operations like multiplications, divisions, and factorizations.

## 28.Gunita Samuchyah: Samuchya Gunitah

This Vedic Math sub-sutra is intended for the purpose of verifying the correctness of obtained answers in multiplications, divisions, and factorizations. It provides a quick way to check if a calculated answer is correct, especially when dealing with algebraic expressions.

**How it works (General Steps):**

The method involves substituting a simple numerical value for the variable(s) in both the original problem and the obtained answer. If the numerical results match, the algebraic answer is likely correct.

1.  **Choose a Substitution Value:** Select a simple numerical value for 'x' (or any other variable). The video's presenter uses $x=1$ for demonstration.

2.  **Evaluate the Original Expression:** Substitute the chosen value of 'x' into the original algebraic expression and calculate the numerical result.

3.  **Evaluate the Obtained Answer:** Substitute the same value of 'x' into the simplified or factored answer and calculate the numerical result.

4.  **Compare Results:** If the numerical results from steps 2 and 3 are identical, then the algebraic simplification, multiplication, division, or factorization is considered correct.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

### Example 1: $(x+4)(x+3) = x^2 + 7x + 12$

**Verification using $x=1$:**

1.  **Original Expression:** $(x+4)(x+3)$
    *   Substitute $x=1$: $(1+4)(1+3) = (5)(4) = 20$.

2.  **Obtained Answer:** $x^2 + 7x + 12$
    *   Substitute $x=1$: $(1)^2 + 7(1) + 12 = 1 + 7 + 12 = 20$.

3.  **Comparison:** Both sides yield 20.
    *   **Conclusion:** The answer is correct.

### Example 2: $(x-4)(2x+5) = 2x^2 - 3x - 20$

**Verification using $x=1$:**

1.  **Original Expression:** $(x-4)(2x+5)$
    *   Substitute $x=1$: $(1-4)(2(1)+5) = (-3)(2+5) = (-3)(7) = -21$.

2.  **Obtained Answer:** $2x^2 - 3x - 20$
    *   Substitute $x=1$: $2(1)^2 - 3(1) - 20 = 2 - 3 - 20 = -1 - 20 = -21$.

3.  **Comparison:** Both sides yield -21.
    *   **Conclusion:** The answer is correct.

**Key Points:**

*   This trick (Gunita Samuchyah: Samuchya Gunitah) serves as an effective verification method, not a direct problem-solving technique.
*   By substituting a simple number (like 1, or even 0, 2, etc.) into both the original problem and the derived answer, one can quickly check for consistency.
*   If the numerical results match, it provides strong confidence in the correctness of the algebraic manipulation.
*   This method is particularly valuable in competitive exams where quickly checking answers can save time and prevent errors.
*   The presenter emphasizes that choosing a simple integer for substitution makes the calculations easy and fast.
* The video introduces "Gunita Samuchyah," a Vedic Math concept related to "Samuchya Gunitah." This sub-sutra is primarily used for verifying the correctness of answers obtained in multiplications, divisions, and factorizations in algebra. It helps determine if the calculated result of an algebraic expression matches a given or expected answer.

## 29.Gunita Samuchyah

"Gunita Samuchyah" (The product of the sum is equal to the sum of the product) is a Vedic Math principle employed to verify the accuracy of algebraic computations. It works by substituting a numerical value into both the original expression and the proposed answer. If the numerical results match, the algebraic solution is considered correct.

**How it works:**

1.  **Choose a Test Value for the Variable:** Select a simple numerical value for the variable (e.g., x=1, x=0). The simpler the number, the easier the calculations will be.
2.  **Calculate the Numerical Value of the Original Expression:** Substitute the chosen test value into the original algebraic expression.
3.  **Calculate the Numerical Value of the Answer:** Substitute the same test value into the provided (or derived) answer.
4.  **Compare the Results:** If the numerical results from steps 2 and 3 are identical, then the algebraic solution is highly likely to be correct.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

### Example 1: $(x+3)(x+2) = x^2 + 5x + 6$

**Verification using $x=1$:**

1.  **Original Expression:** $(x+3)(x+2)$
    *   Substitute $x=1$: $(1+3)(1+2) = (4)(3) = 12$.

2.  **Proposed Answer:** $x^2 + 5x + 6$
    *   Substitute $x=1$: $(1)^2 + 5(1) + 6 = 1 + 5 + 6 = 12$.

3.  **Comparison:** Both sides yield 12.
    *   **Conclusion:** The answer is correct.

### Example 2: $(x-4)(2x+5) = 2x^2 - 3x - 20$

**Verification using $x=1$:**

1.  **Original Expression:** $(x-4)(2x+5)$
    *   Substitute $x=1$: $(1-4)(2(1)+5) = (-3)(2+5) = (-3)(7) = -21$.

2.  **Proposed Answer:** $2x^2 - 3x - 20$
    *   Substitute $x=1$: $2(1)^2 - 3(1) - 20 = 2 - 3 - 20 = -1 - 20 = -21$.

3.  **Comparison:** Both sides yield -21.
    *   **Conclusion:** The answer is correct.

**Key Points:**

*   **Purpose:** Gunita Samuchyah is a verification method, not a direct calculation method. It's used to check the accuracy of an already obtained answer.
*   **Simplicity:** The effectiveness of this trick comes from choosing a simple numerical value for the variable, which makes the arithmetic easy and quick.
*   **Broad Applicability:** It can be applied to various algebraic operations, including multiplication, division, and factorization of polynomials.
*   **Confidence Building:** Matching numerical results from both the original expression and the answer builds confidence in the correctness of the algebraic manipulation.
* The video introduces "Gunakasamuchyah," a Vedic Math trick used for verifying the correctness of answers in algebraic factorizations. This method is a sub-sutra of "Gunita Samuchyah" and "Samuchya Gunitah" and is presented as a valuable tool for quickly checking solutions, especially in competitive exams.

## 30.Gunakasamuchyah

"Gunakasamuchyah" (The factors of the sum is equal to the sum of the factors) is a Vedic Math principle designed to verify algebraic factorizations. The core idea is that if an algebraic expression is correctly factored, then substituting a numerical value into both the original expression (after summing its coefficients) and the factored form (after summing the coefficients within each factor and then multiplying them) should yield the same numerical result.

**How it works (General Steps):**

1.  **Choose a Test Value for the Variable:** Select a simple numerical value for 'x' (or any other variable). The presenter typically uses $x=1$ for its ease of calculation.

2.  **Evaluate the Original Expression (Sum of Coefficients):**
    *   For the original polynomial (e.g., $Ax^2 + Bx + C$), sum its coefficients and constant term: $A + B + C$.

3.  **Evaluate the Factored Form (Product of Sums of Coefficients):**
    *   For each factor in the factored form (e.g., $(Dx+E)(Fx+G)$), sum its coefficients and constant term: $(D+E)$ and $(F+G)$.
    *   Then, multiply these sums together: $(D+E) \times (F+G)$.

4.  **Compare Results:** If the numerical results from steps 2 and 3 are identical, then the factorization is considered correct.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

### Example 1: $4x^2 + 12x + 5 = (2x+1)(2x+5)$

**Verification using $x=1$ (as shown in the video's explanation of the method using coefficients):**

1.  **Original Expression:** $4x^2 + 12x + 5$
    *   Sum of coefficients: $4 + 12 + 5 = 21$.

2.  **Factored Form:** $(2x+1)(2x+5)$
    *   Sum of coefficients for $(2x+1)$: $2 + 1 = 3$.
    *   Sum of coefficients for $(2x+5)$: $2 + 5 = 7$.
    *   Product of sums: $3 \times 7 = 21$.

3.  **Comparison:** Both sides yield 21.
    *   **Conclusion:** The factorization is correct.

### Example 2: $(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6$

**Verification using $x=1$ (as shown in the video's explanation of the method using coefficients):**

1.  **Original Expression:** $x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6$
    *   Sum of coefficients: $1 + 6 + 11 + 6 = 24$.

2.  **Factored Form:** $(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)$
    *   Sum of coefficients for $(x+1)$: $1 + 1 = 2$.
    *   Sum of coefficients for $(x+2)$: $1 + 2 = 3$.
    *   Sum of coefficients for $(x+3)$: $1 + 3 = 4$.
    *   Product of sums: $2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24$.

3.  **Comparison:** Both sides yield 24.
    *   **Conclusion:** The factorization is correct.

**Key Points:**

*   **Verification Tool:** Gunakasamuchyah is a powerful tool for quickly checking the correctness of algebraic factorizations.
*   **Coefficient Sum:** The essence of the trick lies in the property that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is equal to the product of the sums of the coefficients of its factors when $x=1$.
*   **Efficiency:** This method significantly reduces the time required for verification, especially for longer polynomials or multiple-choice questions.
*   **Practice:** The presenter emphasizes that consistent practice is key to mastering this and other Vedic Math techniques.
* ## 31.Baudhayana Sulbasutra: Concept of Pi ($\pi$)

The Baudhayana Sulbasutra, an ancient Indian text, discusses the concept of Pi ($\pi$), primarily in the context of constructing altars for Vedic rituals. While not explicitly defining Pi as a constant in the modern sense, the text provides various approximations for it through geometric constructions involving circles and squares.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Pi as a Ratio:** The fundamental understanding of Pi in the Baudhayana Sulbasutra is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
    $$ \pi = \frac{\text{Circumference}}{\text{Diameter}} $$
*   **Approximations of Pi:**
    *   **3:1 Ratio:** The video highlights a core concept from the Baudhayana Sulbasutra: the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle is approximately **3:1**. This suggests that the circumference is roughly three times the diameter.
    *   **Other Values:** The Sulbasutra also presents other approximations for Pi derived from different geometric constructions, such as 3.004, 3.088, and 3.125. Aryabhatta, another Indian mathematician, later calculated a more accurate value of Pi to be 3.1416 in 499 AD.
*   **Geometric Equivalence:** The text explores methods to construct a circle with an area almost equal to a given square and vice versa. These procedures implicitly provide values for Pi.
*   **Practical Application:** The mathematical concepts, including the approximations of Pi, were crucial for the precise construction of sacrificial altars, which often involved circular and square shapes.

**Circumference and Diameter Relationship:**

The video emphasizes that if you consider a rope used to define the radius of a circle, and then use that same rope to form the entire circumference, the ratio of the circumference to the diameter would be 3:1. This is a practical way to visualize the relationship between these two measurements.

**Implications for Problem Solving:**

Understanding this approximate 3:1 ratio, even though it's not the exact value of Pi (approximately 3.14159), can be useful for quickly solving certain problems, particularly those encountered in competitive exams or Olympiads, as mentioned in the video.

**Note on Pi Value:**
While the video mentions $\pi \approx 3.14$ or $22/7$, the Baudhayana Sulbasutra itself offered various approximations, with some texts indicating an approximate value of 3. Other Sulbasutras, like the Manava Sulbasutra, approximated Pi as 3.125.

## 32.Area of a Rectangular Path (Baudhayana Shulbasutra Method)

This method, inspired by the Baudhayana Shulbasutra, provides a shortcut for calculating the area of a path surrounding a rectangular field.

**How it works:**

The formula used for the area of the path (Area of Path) is:
$$ \text{Area of Path} = (L + B + 2W) \times 2W $$
Where:
*   $L$ is the length of the inner rectangle.
*   $B$ is the breadth of the inner rectangle.
*   $W$ is the width of the path.

This formula directly calculates the area of the path without needing to find the area of the outer rectangle and then subtracting the area of the inner rectangle.

**Example from the video (with solution):**

*   **Problem:**
    The length and breadth of a rectangular field are $17\text{cm}$ and $15\text{cm}$ respectively. A path surrounds the field measuring $2\text{m}$ width. Find the area of the rectangular field.

*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Identify the given values:**
        *   Length ($L$) = $17\text{cm}$
        *   Breadth ($B$) = $15\text{cm}$
        *   Path width ($W$) = $2\text{m}$

    2.  **Convert units if necessary:**
        The length and breadth are in centimeters, while the path width is in meters. To ensure consistent units, convert the path width to centimeters:
        $W = 2\text{m} = 2 \times 100\text{cm} = 200\text{cm}$.
        *(Note: The video uses 'm' for meters in the question and 'cm' for centimeters in the calculation without explicit conversion, but for accurate calculation, unit conversion is crucial.)*
        For the purpose of demonstrating the trick as shown in the video, we will proceed with the values as used in the video, where the "2m width" seems to be treated as "2 units" that get doubled to "4 units" for the 2W term, implying a consistent unit context (e.g., all in cm or all in m, where the '2m' acts as a numerical value of 2). Based on the video's calculation (17+15+4)x4, it implicitly treats the '2m width' as simply '2' in the same units as the length and breadth. So, $2W = 2 \times 2 = 4$.

    3.  **Apply the formula:**
        Area of Path $= (L + B + 2W) \times 2W$
        Area of Path $= (17 + 15 + (2 \times 2)) \times (2 \times 2)$
        Area of Path $= (17 + 15 + 4) \times 4$
        Area of Path $= (32 + 4) \times 4$
        Area of Path $= 36 \times 4$
        Area of Path $= 144$

    4.  **State the units for the result:**
        Since the lengths were in centimeters, the area will be in square centimeters.
        **Result:** $144\text{ cm}^2$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick provides a quick and efficient way to calculate the area of a path surrounding a rectangle.
*   It is particularly useful for competitive exams where time is a critical factor.
*   Ensure all measurements (length, breadth, and path width) are in the same units before applying the formula. If they are not, convert them to a consistent unit.
* ## 33.Area of a Rectangular Path (Inside the Field - Baudhayana Shulbasutra Method)

This method, inspired by the Baudhayana Shulbasutra, provides a shortcut for calculating the area of a path *inside* a rectangular field.

**How it works:**

The formula used for the area of the path (Area of Path) when it's *inside* the field is:
$$ \text{Area of Path} = (L + B - 2W) \times 2W $$
Where:
*   $L$ is the length of the outer (original) rectangle.
*   $B$ is the breadth of the outer (original) rectangle.
*   $W$ is the width of the path.

This formula is similar to the one for a path surrounding the field, with the key difference being the subtraction of $2W$ inside the parenthesis instead of addition, reflecting that the path reduces the dimensions for the inner area.

**Example from the video (with solution):**

*   **Problem:**
    The length and breadth of a rectangle field is $24\text{cm}$ and $20\text{cm}$ respectively. A path is inside the field measuring $2\text{m}$ width. Find the area of the path.

*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Identify the given values:**
        *   Length ($L$) = $24\text{cm}$
        *   Breadth ($B$) = $20\text{cm}$
        *   Path width ($W$) = $2\text{m}$

    2.  **Convert units if necessary:**
        The length and breadth are in centimeters, while the path width is in meters. To ensure consistent units, convert the path width to centimeters:
        $W = 2\text{m} = 2 \times 100\text{cm} = 200\text{cm}$.
        *(Note: The video uses 'm' for meters in the question and 'cm' for centimeters in the calculation without explicit conversion, but for accurate calculation, unit conversion is crucial.)*
        For the purpose of demonstrating the trick as shown in the video, we will proceed with the values as used in the video, where the "2m width" seems to be treated as "2 units" that get doubled to "4 units" for the 2W term, implying a consistent unit context (e.g., all in cm or all in m, where the '2m' acts as a numerical value of 2). So, $2W = 2 \times 2 = 4$.

    3.  **Apply the formula:**
        Area of Path $= (L + B - 2W) \times 2W$
        Area of Path $= (24 + 20 - (2 \times 2)) \times (2 \times 2)$
        Area of Path $= (24 + 20 - 4) \times 4$
        Area of Path $= (44 - 4) \times 4$
        Area of Path $= 40 \times 4$
        Area of Path $= 160$

    4.  **State the units for the result:**
        Since the lengths were in centimeters, the area will be in square centimeters.
        **Result:** $160\text{ cm}^2$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is a quick and efficient way to calculate the area of an *inner* path within a rectangle.
*   The only difference from the "path surrounding the field" formula is the minus sign before $2W$ inside the parenthesis.
*   Ensure all measurements (length, breadth, and path width) are in the same units before applying the formula. If they are not, convert them to a consistent unit.
* The user has provided three video segments about geometric concepts from the Baudhayana Shulbasutra. I will now extract the data from the third video segment on "Circling a 2D Figure".

## 34.Baudhayana Shulbasutra (Circling a 2D Figure)

This segment explains relationships between squares, circles, and rectangles, focusing on how a circle relates to these 2D figures when inscribed within or circumscribing them. The speaker highlights key relationships that can be used for problem-solving.

**Key Geometric Relationships:**

The speaker outlines three main scenarios:

1.  **Circle Inscribed in a Square:**
    *   **Relationship:** The diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the side length of the square.
    *   **Formula:** $2R = a$, where $R$ is the radius of the circle and $a$ is the side of the square.

2.  **Square Inscribed in a Circle:**
    *   **Relationship:** The diagonal of the inscribed square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
    *   **Formula:** The diagonal of a square with side 'a' is $\sqrt{2}a$. Therefore, the diameter of the circle $D = \sqrt{2}a$.
    *   **Note:** The radius of the circle would be $R = \frac{\sqrt{2}a}{2} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}$.

3.  **Circle Inscribed in a Rectangle:**
    *   **Scenario:** This applies when a rectangle has a sphere or circular object placed inside it, or when cutting out the largest possible circle from a rectangular piece.
    *   **Relationship:** The diameter of the largest circle that can be inscribed within a rectangle is equal to the shortest side (breadth) of the rectangle.
    *   **Example from video:** If a rectangle has a length of $20\text{cm}$ and a breadth of $15\text{cm}$, the diameter of the largest inscribed circle would be $15\text{cm}$.

**Importance in Problem Solving:**

The speaker emphasizes that understanding these relationships is crucial for solving various geometry problems, particularly in competitive exams. These concepts help to quickly determine unknown dimensions (like radii or diameters) when a circle is related to a square or a rectangle. Mastery of these principles allows for direct solutions without complex calculations.
## 35.Algebra Division (Paravartya Yojayet Method)

This method, known as Paravartya Yojayet in Vedic Mathematics, provides a quick and efficient way to perform algebraic division, especially when the divisor is a linear expression.

**How it works (using synthetic division principles):**

The Paravartya Yojayet method is a variation of synthetic division. It simplifies the division of a polynomial by a linear factor of the form $(x - a)$ or $(x + a)$.

1.  **Identify the divisor's root:** If the divisor is $(x - a)$, use 'a'. If the divisor is $(x + a)$, use '-a'. This is the 'changed sign' mentioned in the video.
2.  **Write down the coefficients:** Write down the coefficients of the dividend polynomial in a row, making sure to include zeros for any missing terms.
3.  **Perform the synthetic division:**
    *   Bring down the first coefficient.
    *   Multiply this coefficient by the root (from step 1) and write the result under the next coefficient.
    *   Add the numbers in that column.
    *   Repeat the multiplication and addition process until all coefficients have been processed.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{7x^2 + 5x + 3}{x - 1} $$
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Divisor's root: The divisor is $(x - 1)$, so use $+1$.
        2.  Coefficients of dividend: $7$, $5$, $3$.
        3.  Synthetic Division:
            ```
            1 | 7   5   3
              |     7  12
              -----------------
                7  12  15
            ```
        4.  **Result:**
            *   Quotient ($Q$): The coefficients of the quotient are the first two numbers: $7x + 12$.
            *   Remainder ($R$): The last number is the remainder: $15$.

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{x^3 - x^2 + 7x + 3}{x - 3} $$
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Divisor's root: The divisor is $(x - 3)$, so use $+3$.
        2.  Coefficients of dividend: $1$, $-1$, $7$, $3$.
        3.  Synthetic Division:
            ```
            3 | 1  -1   7   3
              |     3   6  39
              -----------------
                1   2  13  42
            ```
        4.  **Result:**
            *   Quotient ($Q$): The coefficients of the quotient are the first three numbers: $x^2 + 2x + 13$.
            *   Remainder ($R$): The last number is the remainder: $42$.

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{x^3 - 3x^2 + 10x - 7}{x - 5} $$
    *   **Solution:**
        1.  Divisor's root: The divisor is $(x - 5)$, so use $+5$.
        2.  Coefficients of dividend: $1$, $-3$, $10$, $-7$.
        3.  Synthetic Division:
            ```
            5 | 1  -3   10  -7
              |     5   10  100
              -------------------
                1   2   20  93
            ```
        4.  **Result:**
            *   Quotient ($Q$): The coefficients of the quotient are the first three numbers: $x^2 + 2x + 20$.
            *   Remainder ($R$): The last number is the remainder: $93$.

**Key Points:**

*   This method is a streamlined approach to polynomial division, particularly useful for linear divisors.
*   The crucial step is to change the sign of the constant term in the divisor to get the 'root' for the synthetic division.
*   The final row of numbers provides the coefficients of the quotient (one degree less than the original polynomial) and the remainder.
* ## 36.Algebra Division (Urdhva Tiryagbhyam)

This video demonstrates a Vedic math trick called "Urdhva Tiryagbhyam" for performing algebraic division. This method aims to find the quotient and remainder quickly, often in a single step, without the need for traditional long division or remainder theorem calculations.

**How it works:**

1.  **Rewrite the Divisor:** If the divisor is in the form $(x - a)$, rewrite it as $(x + a)$ by changing the sign of the constant term.

2.  **Divide the Leading Terms:** Divide the leading term of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. This gives the first term of the quotient.

3.  **Multiply and Add (Iterative Process):**
    *   Multiply the most recently obtained term of the quotient by the constant term of the rewritten divisor.
    *   Add this product to the next coefficient of the dividend.
    *   Divide the result by the leading term of the divisor (which is usually 'x', so effectively just consider the coefficient). This gives the next term of the quotient.
    *   Repeat this process until all terms of the dividend have been processed. The last number obtained is the remainder.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: Divide $x^3 + 7x^2 + 9x + 11$ by $x - 2$.
    *   Rewrite divisor: $x + 2$.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   $x^3 \div x = x^2$ (First term of quotient).
        *   $x^2 \times 2 = 2x^2$.
        *   $7x^2 + 2x^2 = 9x^2$.
        *   $9x^2 \div x = 9x$ (Next term of quotient).
        *   $9x \times 2 = 18x$.
        *   $9x + 18x = 27x$.
        *   $27x \div x = 27$ (Next term of quotient).
        *   $27 \times 2 = 54$.
        *   $11 + 54 = 65$ (Remainder).
    *   **Result:**
        *   Quotient (Q): $x^2 + 9x + 27$
        *   Remainder (R): $65$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: Divide $x^3 - x^2 - 7x + 3$ by $x - 3$.
    *   Rewrite divisor: $x + 3$.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   $x^3 \div x = x^2$ (First term of quotient).
        *   $x^2 \times 3 = 3x^2$.
        *   $-x^2 + 3x^2 = 2x^2$.
        *   $2x^2 \div x = 2x$ (Next term of quotient).
        *   $2x \times 3 = 6x$.
        *   $-7x + 6x = -x$.
        *   $-x \div x = -1$ (Next term of quotient).
        *   $-1 \times 3 = -3$.
        *   $3 + (-3) = 0$ (Remainder).
    *   **Result:**
        *   Quotient (Q): $x^2 + 2x - 1$
        *   Remainder (R): $0$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: Divide $x^4 - 3x^3 + 7x^2 + 5x + 7$ by $x - 4$.
    *   Rewrite divisor: $x + 4$.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   $x^4 \div x = x^3$ (First term of quotient).
        *   $x^3 \times 4 = 4x^3$.
        *   $-3x^3 + 4x^3 = x^3$.
        *   $x^3 \div x = x^2$ (Next term of quotient).
        *   $x^2 \times 4 = 4x^2$.
        *   $7x^2 + 4x^2 = 11x^2$.
        *   $11x^2 \div x = 11x$ (Next term of quotient).
        *   $11x \times 4 = 44x$.
        *   $5x + 44x = 49x$.
        *   $49x \div x = 49$ (Next term of quotient).
        *   $49 \times 4 = 196$.
        *   $7 + 196 = 203$ (Remainder).
    *   **Result:**
        *   Quotient (Q): $x^3 + x^2 + 11x + 49$
        *   Remainder (R): $203$

**Key Points:**

*   This Vedic math technique simplifies polynomial division, especially when the divisor is a linear factor.
*   Practicing this method can lead to faster calculations in competitive exams.
* ## 37.Surds

This video introduces the concept of surds in mathematics.

**Definition:**
Surds are numbers left in root form ($\sqrt{}$) to express their exact value. They cannot be simplified to remove the square root (or cube root, etc.) and result in an exact integer or a finite decimal. Surds have an infinite number of non-recurring decimals, making them irrational numbers.

**How to identify a surd:**

1.  **Evaluate the root:** Try to simplify the given root.
2.  **Check for exact value:**
    *   If the root can be simplified to a whole number (e.g., $\sqrt{4} = 2$), it is **not** a surd.
    *   If the root results in an infinite, non-repeating decimal (e.g., $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142135...$, $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.7320508...$), then it **is** a surd.

**Relationship to powers and roots:**
The concept of a root is the inverse operation of a power.
*   For example, $5^2 = 5 \times 5 = 25$. The square root of 25, $\sqrt{25}$, is 5.

**Examples of perfect squares and their roots (not surds):**
*   $1 \times 1 = 1 \implies \sqrt{1} = 1$
*   $2 \times 2 = 4 \implies \sqrt{4} = 2$
*   $3 \times 3 = 9 \implies \sqrt{9} = 3$
*   $4 \times 4 = 16 \implies \sqrt{16} = 4$
*   $5 \times 5 = 25 \implies \sqrt{25} = 5$
*   $6 \times 6 = 36 \implies \sqrt{36} = 6$
*   $7 \times 7 = 49 \implies \sqrt{49} = 7$

**Examples of surds:**
*   $\sqrt{2}$ (cannot be simplified to a whole number)
*   $\sqrt{3}$ (cannot be simplified to a whole number)

**Types of roots:**
*   **Square root ($\sqrt{}$):** Implies finding a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals the radicand. The index 2 is usually omitted. For example, $\sqrt{25}$ is the square root of 25.
*   **Cube root ($\sqrt{}$):** Implies finding a number that, when multiplied by itself three times, equals the radicand. For example, $\sqrt{216}$ (cube root of 216) is 6, because $6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216$.
*   **Fourth root ($\sqrt{}$):** Implies finding a number that, when multiplied by itself four times, equals the radicand. For example, $\sqrt{16}$ (fourth root of 16) is 2, because $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$.

**Important Note:** The video emphasizes the importance of learning squares and cubes of numbers as a foundational step to understanding surds.
# 38.Binary numbers 
A binary number system is one of the four types of number systems used in computer applications. Binary numbers are represented using only two symbols or digits: 0 (zero) and 1 (one). These numbers are expressed in the base-2 numeral system. For instance, (101)2 is a binary number.

Here's how to convert binary numbers to decimal numbers and vice versa: 

### Converting Binary to Decimal:

To convert a binary number to its decimal equivalent, you multiply each digit by 2 raised to the power of its position, starting from the rightmost digit with a power of 0.

**Example 1: Convert (101)2 to Decimal**
1.  Identify the digits and their positions (from right to left, starting at 0):
    *   1 is at position 2
    *   0 is at position 1
    *   1 is at position 0
2.  Multiply each digit by 2 raised to its position's power:
    *   (1 × 2^2) + (0 × 2^1) + (1 × 2^0)
3.  Calculate the values:
    *   (1 × 4) + (0 × 2) + (1 × 1)
    *   4 + 0 + 1 = 5
    Therefore, (101)2 = 5.

**Example 2: Convert (10110)2 to Decimal**
1.  Identify the digits and their positions:
    *   1 is at position 4
    *   0 is at position 3
    *   1 is at position 2
    *   1 is at position 1
    *   0 is at position 0
2.  Multiply each digit by 2 raised to its position's power:
    *   (1 × 2^4) + (0 × 2^3) + (1 × 2^2) + (1 × 2^1) + (0 × 2^0)
3.  Calculate the values:
    *   (1 × 16) + (0 × 8) + (1 × 4) + (1 × 2) + (0 × 1)
    *   16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 22
    Therefore, (10110)2 = 22.

**Example 3: Convert (11111)2 to Decimal**
1.  Identify the digits and their positions:
    *   1 is at position 4
    *   1 is at position 3
    *   1 is at position 2
    *   1 is at position 1
    *   1 is at position 0
2.  Multiply each digit by 2 raised to its position's power:
    *   (1 × 2^4) + (1 × 2^3) + (1 × 2^2) + (1 × 2^1) + (1 × 2^0)
3.  Calculate the values:
    *   (1 × 16) + (1 × 8) + (1 × 4) + (1 × 2) + (1 × 1)
    *   16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 31
    Therefore, (11111)2 = 31.

### Converting Decimal to Binary:

To convert a decimal number to its binary equivalent, you repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and note the remainder. You continue this process until the quotient is 0. The binary number is then formed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.

**Example: Convert 45 to Binary**
1.  Divide 45 by 2:
    *   45 ÷ 2 = 22, remainder 1
2.  Divide 22 by 2:
    *   22 ÷ 2 = 11, remainder 0
3.  Divide 11 by 2:
    *   11 ÷ 2 = 5, remainder 1
4.  Divide 5 by 2:
    *   5 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 1
5.  Divide 2 by 2:
    *   2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0
6.  Divide 1 by 2:
    *   1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1
7.  Read the remainders from bottom to top: 101101
    Therefore, 45 = (101101)2.
    # 39.Roman numbers 
    The video discusses Roman numerals, an ancient number system that is still in use today. In this system, letters are used to represent fixed positive numbers. The primary Roman numerals are I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, which represent 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000, respectively.

Here are the key rules for forming and interpreting Roman numerals:

### Rules for Roman Numerals:

1.  **Repetition:** A Roman numeral cannot be repeated more than three times in a row.
    *   For example, 3 is written as III.
    *   However, 4 is not written as IIII. Instead, it is written as IV.
    *   Similarly, 9 is not written as VIIII but as IX.
    *   This rule extends to other numerals as well. For instance, 40 is not XXXX but XL.

2.  **Subtraction:**
    *   If a smaller numeral is placed to the left of a larger numeral, it is subtracted from the larger numeral.
        *   For example, IV represents 5 - 1 = 4.
        *   IX represents 10 - 1 = 9.
        *   XL represents 50 - 10 = 40.
        *   CD represents 500 - 100 = 400.
        *   CM represents 1000 - 100 = 900.
    *   Only specific subtractions are allowed:
        *   I can be subtracted from V (5) and X (10).
        *   X can be subtracted from L (50) and C (100).
        *   C can be subtracted from D (500) and M (1000).

3.  **Addition:**
    *   If a smaller numeral is placed to the right of a larger numeral, it is added to the larger numeral.
        *   For example, VI represents 5 + 1 = 6.
        *   XI represents 10 + 1 = 11.
        *   LX represents 50 + 10 = 60.

4.  **No Repetition of V, L, D:** The numerals V, L, and D are never repeated.
    *   For instance, 10 is always X, not VV.

### Examples from the Video:

The video illustrates several examples of Roman numerals and their decimal equivalents, and vice versa.

*   **I = 1**
*   **II = 2**
*   **III = 3**
*   **IV = 4**
*   **V = 5**
*   **VI = 6**
*   **VII = 7**
*   **VIII = 8**
*   **IX = 9**
*   **X = 10**

The video also demonstrates converting a decimal number to Roman numerals. For example, converting 40 to Roman numerals.
*   We know L = 50. To get 40, we need to subtract 10 from 50. Since a smaller numeral to the left indicates subtraction, 40 is written as XL (50 - 10 = 40).

The video further explains that when there are multiple ways to represent a number (e.g., if writing VIII as 5+3 is possible instead of X-2), the additive approach is generally preferred if it adheres to the other rules (like not repeating numerals more than three times).
## 40.Factorials

A factorial is a function that multiplies a number by every number below it until it reaches 1. The symbol for factorial is an exclamation mark (!).

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the number:** The number before the exclamation mark is the starting point for the multiplication.
2.  **Multiply downwards:** Multiply the number by each integer less than it, all the way down to 1.

**General Formula:**

For a non-negative integer 'n', the factorial of 'n' (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'.
$$ n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 2 \times 1 $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1: 3!**
    *   Problem: Find the factorial of 3.
    *   Calculation: $3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$
    *   **Result:** $3! = 6$

*   **Example 2: 5!**
    *   Problem: Find the factorial of 5.
    *   Calculation: $5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120$
    *   **Result:** $5! = 120$

*   **Example 3: 4!**
    *   Problem: Find the factorial of 4.
    *   Calculation: $4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$
    *   **Result:** $4! = 24$

*   **Example 4: 2!**
    *   Problem: Find the factorial of 2.
    *   Calculation: $2 \times 1 = 2$
    *   **Result:** $2! = 2$

*   **Example 5: 1!**
    *   Problem: Find the factorial of 1.
    *   Calculation: $1$
    *   **Result:** $1! = 1$

**Key Points:**

*   Factorials are commonly used in mathematics, particularly in the fields of permutations and combinations.
*   The factorial of 0 is defined as 1 ($0! = 1$).
*   Factorials are only defined for non-negative integers.
* ## 41.Permutation

Permutation refers to a mathematical calculation of the number of ways a particular set of objects can be arranged. It is used when the order of arrangement matters.

The formula for permutation is denoted as $^nP_r$, where:
*   **n** represents the total number of objects.
*   **r** represents the number of objects to be selected from the total.

**Formula for Permutation:**
$$ ^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} $$
Here, "!" denotes the factorial, which means multiplying a number by every whole number below it until 1. For example, $5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$.

**Example from the video (with solution):**

*   **Problem:** In a panchayat, there are 30 committee members. We need to select one president and one vice-president from these 30 members. How many ways can this be done?

    *   **Identify n and r:**
        *   Total number of committee members (n) = 30
        *   Number of positions to be selected (r) = 2 (President and Vice-President)

    *   **Apply the formula:**
        $$ ^{30}P_2 = \frac{30!}{(30-2)!} $$
        $$ ^{30}P_2 = \frac{30!}{28!} $$
        $$ ^{30}P_2 = \frac{30 \times 29 \times 28 \times \ldots \times 1}{28 \times 27 \times \ldots \times 1} $$
        We can cancel out $28!$ from the numerator and denominator:
        $$ ^{30}P_2 = 30 \times 29 $$
        $$ ^{30}P_2 = 870 $$

    *   **Result:** There are 870 ways to select one president and one vice-president from 30 committee members.

**Key Points:**

*   Permutations are used when the order of selection or arrangement is important.
*   The formula helps calculate the number of possible ordered arrangements.
*   The factorial symbol (!) represents the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number.
*   Permutations are often encountered in problems involving arranging items, selecting leaders for specific roles, or forming numbers/words from a given set of digits/letters.
# * 42.Combination
* A combination is a mathematical technique used to determine the number of possible arrangements in a collection of items where the order of selection does not matter. It's also referred to as a selection. This is in contrast to permutations, where the order of selected items is essential.

### Combination Formula

The formula for calculating combinations of 'n' different things taken 'r' at a time is denoted as nCr and is given by:

$$ nCr = \frac{n!}{r! * (n-r)!} $$

Where:
*   `n` is the total number of elements in a set.
*   `r` is the number of selected objects (the order of the objects is not important).
*   `!` denotes the factorial.

**Key Points to Remember for Combination Formula**
*   The formula applies when $0 \le r \le n$.
*   $nC_r = nC_{(n-r)}$, meaning selecting 'r' objects is the same as rejecting '(n-r)' objects.
*   $nC_0 = 1$ (choosing none means only one way - choose nothing).

### Permutation vs. Combination

The primary difference between permutations and combinations lies in whether the order of outcomes matters:

*   **Permutations**: The order of outcomes matters.
*   **Combinations**: The order of outcomes does not matter.

Here are some examples to illustrate the distinction:

| Permutation                                          | Combination                                        |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Sequence of numbers for a lock.                 | Numbers for winning the lottery.              |
| Selecting individuals for a team by position.   | Selecting children to be members of a class.  |
| Picking first, second, and third place.         | Picking three finalists.                      |
| Arranging books on a shelf.                     | Choosing toppings for a pizza.        |
| Creating a password.                            | Selecting a committee.                        |
| Arranging people in a line.                     | Selecting a group of objects or alphabets.    |
| Assigning positions (e.g., captain, goalkeeper). | Forming a team or committee.                  |

### Examples

**1. In how many ways can 4 students be chosen from 10 students?**

Since the order in which the students are chosen does not matter, this is a combination problem.

Here, n = 10 (total students) and r = 4 (students to be chosen).

Using the combination formula:
$$ nCr = \frac{n!}{r! * (n-r)!} $$
$$ 10C4 = \frac{10!}{4! * (10-4)!} $$
$$ 10C4 = \frac{10!}{4! * 6!} $$
$$ 10C4 = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{(4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1) \times (6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1)} $$
$$ 10C4 = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} $$
$$ 10C4 = \frac{5040}{24} $$
$$ 10C4 = 210 $$

Therefore, there are 210 ways to choose 4 students from a class of 10.

**2. In how many ways can a set of 4 numbers be chosen from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11?**

Since the problem asks for selecting a set of numbers, and the order of selection does not matter, this is a combination problem.

Here, n = 11 (total numbers available) and r = 4 (numbers to be chosen).

Using the combination formula:
$$ nCr = \frac{n!}{r! * (n-r)!} $$
$$ 11C4 = \frac{11!}{4! * (11-4)!} $$
$$ 11C4 = \frac{11!}{4! * 7!} $$
$$ 11C4 = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{(4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1) \times (7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1)} $$
$$ 11C4 = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} $$
$$ 11C4 = \frac{7920}{24} $$
$$ 11C4 = 330 $$

Therefore, there are 330 ways to choose a set of 4 numbers from the given list of 11 numbers.
## 43.Sunyam Samya Samuchyah (Model 6)

This video demonstrates advanced techniques for solving specific types of integration problems, focusing on a pattern where the numerators and denominators of fractions have a particular relationship.

**Problem 1: Basic Pattern Recognition**

The first problem presented is:
$$ \frac{x - 3}{x - 4} + \frac{x - 4}{x - 5} = \frac{x - 2}{x - 3} + \frac{x - 5}{x - 6} $$

The presenter highlights a pattern: the numerator of each fraction is one less than the denominator. To solve this efficiently, the trick is to rewrite each term in a specific way.

*   $\frac{x - 3}{x - 4} = \frac{(x - 4) + 1}{x - 4} = 1 + \frac{1}{x - 4}$
*   $\frac{x - 4}{x - 5} = \frac{(x - 5) + 1}{x - 5} = 1 + \frac{1}{x - 5}$
*   $\frac{x - 2}{x - 3} = \frac{(x - 3) - 1}{x - 3} = 1 - \frac{1}{x - 3}$  (Note: this term is slightly different in the video as $x-2$ not $x-3$)
*   $\frac{x - 5}{x - 6} = \frac{(x - 6) + 1}{x - 6} = 1 + \frac{1}{x - 6}$

By rewriting the terms, the equation becomes:
$$ 1 + \frac{1}{x - 4} + 1 + \frac{1}{x - 5} = 1 - \frac{1}{x - 3} + 1 + \frac{1}{x - 6} $$
$$ 2 + \frac{1}{x - 4} + \frac{1}{x - 5} = 2 - \frac{1}{x - 3} + \frac{1}{x - 6} $$

Canceling out the '2' from both sides, we get:
$$ \frac{1}{x - 4} + \frac{1}{x - 5} = - \frac{1}{x - 3} + \frac{1}{x - 6} $$

Rearranging the terms to group them:
$$ \frac{1}{x - 4} + \frac{1}{x - 3} = \frac{1}{x - 6} - \frac{1}{x - 5} $$

The presenter then demonstrates the key insight: If we add the constants in the denominators of the terms on each side:
*   Left side: $(-4) + (-3) = -7$
*   Right side: $(-6) + (-5) = -11$

Since these sums are not equal, the presenter uses a different grouping strategy. They group the terms such that the sum of the constants in the denominators on each side is equal.

*   Group 1: $\frac{1}{x-4} + \frac{1}{x-5}$  -> Constants: $-4, -5$. Sum: $-9$.
*   Group 2: $\frac{1}{x-3} + \frac{1}{x-6}$  -> Constants: $-3, -6$. Sum: $-9$.

By grouping the terms this way, we can simplify:
$$ \left(\frac{1}{x-4} + \frac{1}{x-5}\right) = \left(\frac{1}{x-3} + \frac{1}{x-6}\right) $$

To solve this, we can use the property that if $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d}$, and $a+b = c+d$, then it implies $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{a+b}{ab}$ and $\frac{1}{c} + \frac{1}{d} = \frac{c+d}{cd}$. Since $a+b=c+d$, this means $\frac{a+b}{ab} = \frac{c+d}{cd}$. Since $a+b=c+d$ and they are non-zero, we can cancel them out, leaving $1/ab = 1/cd$, which implies $ab=cd$.

Applying this to the problem:
$$ \frac{(x-5) + (x-4)}{(x-4)(x-5)} = \frac{(x-6) + (x-3)}{(x-3)(x-6)} $$
$$ \frac{2x - 9}{(x-4)(x-5)} = \frac{2x - 9}{(x-3)(x-6)} $$

For this equality to hold, either $2x - 9 = 0$ or $(x-4)(x-5) = (x-3)(x-6)$.

Case 1: $2x - 9 = 0 \implies 2x = 9 \implies x = 4.5$

Case 2: $(x-4)(x-5) = (x-3)(x-6)$
$x^2 - 9x + 20 = x^2 - 9x + 18$
$20 = 18$, which is false.

Therefore, the only solution is $x = 4.5$.

**Problem 2: Similar Pattern with Coefficients**

The second problem is:
$$ \frac{2x - 3}{2x - 4} + \frac{x - 4}{x - 5} = \frac{2x - 6}{2x - 7} + \frac{x - 1}{x - 2} $$

Here, the pattern is slightly modified. Each term can be rewritten to isolate a constant and a term of the form $\frac{1}{\text{denominator}}$.

*   $\frac{2x - 3}{2x - 4} = \frac{(2x - 4) + 1}{2x - 4} = 1 + \frac{1}{2x - 4}$
*   $\frac{x - 4}{x - 5} = \frac{(x - 5) + 1}{x - 5} = 1 + \frac{1}{x - 5}$
*   $\frac{2x - 6}{2x - 7} = \frac{(2x - 7) + 1}{2x - 7} = 1 + \frac{1}{2x - 7}$
*   $\frac{x - 1}{x - 2} = \frac{(x - 2) - 1}{x - 2} = 1 - \frac{1}{x - 2}$

Substituting these back into the equation:
$$ 1 + \frac{1}{2x - 4} + 1 + \frac{1}{x - 5} = 1 + \frac{1}{2x - 7} + 1 - \frac{1}{x - 2} $$
$$ 2 + \frac{1}{2x - 4} + \frac{1}{x - 5} = 2 + \frac{1}{2x - 7} - \frac{1}{x - 2} $$

Canceling the '2' from both sides:
$$ \frac{1}{2x - 4} + \frac{1}{x - 5} = \frac{1}{2x - 7} - \frac{1}{x - 2} $$

Rearranging:
$$ \frac{1}{2x - 4} + \frac{1}{x - 2} = \frac{1}{2x - 7} - \frac{1}{x - 5} $$

Now, we check the sum of the constants in the denominators on each side:
*   Left side: $(-4) + (-2) = -6$
*   Right side: $(-7) + (-5) = -12$

The sums are not equal. The presenter suggests to group the terms as follows, to make the sums of constants equal:
*   Left side: $\frac{1}{2x-4}$ and $\frac{1}{x-2}$. Denominator constants: $-4$ and $-2$. Sum: $-6$.
*   Right side: $\frac{1}{2x-7}$ and $\frac{1}{x-5}$. Denominator constants: $-7$ and $-5$. Sum: $-12$.

The presenter then applies a transformation by factoring out a 2 from the first term on each side:
$$ \frac{1}{2(x - 2)} + \frac{1}{x - 2} = \frac{1}{2x - 7} - \frac{1}{x - 5} $$
$$ \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{x-2}\right) + \frac{1}{x-2} = \frac{1}{2x-7} - \frac{1}{x-5} $$
$$ \frac{3}{2} \left(\frac{1}{x-2}\right) = \frac{1}{2x-7} - \frac{1}{x-5} $$

This approach doesn't immediately simplify to the previous method. Let's re-examine the structure.

The core idea for solving these types of equations relies on the property that if:
$$ \frac{1}{x+a} + \frac{1}{x+b} = \frac{1}{x+c} + \frac{1}{x+d} $$
and $a+b = c+d$, then the solution can often be found by simplifying these sums:
$$ \frac{(x+b)+(x+a)}{(x+a)(x+b)} = \frac{(x+d)+(x+c)}{(x+c)(x+d)} $$
$$ \frac{2x + (a+b)}{(x+a)(x+b)} = \frac{2x + (c+d)}{(x+c)(x+d)} $$
Since $a+b = c+d$, let $S = a+b = c+d$.
$$ \frac{2x + S}{(x+a)(x+b)} = \frac{2x + S}{(x+c)(x+d)} $$
This equation holds if $2x+S=0$ or if $(x+a)(x+b) = (x+c)(x+d)$.

In Problem 2, let's re-evaluate the grouping to make the sum of constants equal.
The original equation is:
$$ \frac{2x - 3}{2x - 4} + \frac{x - 4}{x - 5} = \frac{2x - 6}{2x - 7} + \frac{x - 1}{x - 2} $$
Consider the transformation $y = x - \frac{9}{2}$.  This is not directly evident from the first step.

Let's use the structure from the first problem directly where we aim to make the sums of constants equal.
We have terms with denominators $(2x-4), (x-5), (2x-7), (x-2)$.
Let's try to group them such that the sum of the constants in the denominators are equal.

Consider the grouping:
Term 1: $\frac{2x-3}{2x-4}$ (constants in denominator: -4)
Term 2: $\frac{x-4}{x-5}$ (constants in denominator: -5)
Term 3: $\frac{2x-6}{2x-7}$ (constants in denominator: -7)
Term 4: $\frac{x-1}{x-2}$ (constants in denominator: -2)

If we group (Term 1 + Term 4) and (Term 2 + Term 3):
Sum of constants for (Term 1 + Term 4): $(-4) + (-2) = -6$
Sum of constants for (Term 2 + Term 3): $(-5) + (-7) = -12$
This grouping doesn't make the sums equal.

Let's try another grouping:
Term 1: $\frac{2x-3}{2x-4}$
Term 2: $\frac{x-4}{x-5}$
Term 3: $\frac{2x-6}{2x-7}$
Term 4: $\frac{x-1}{x-2}$

Consider grouping Term 1 and Term 3, and Term 2 and Term 4.
Sum of constants for (Term 1 + Term 3): $(-4) + (-7) = -11$
Sum of constants for (Term 2 + Term 4): $(-5) + (-2) = -7$
This also doesn't make the sums equal.

The presenter's method of transformation is key here. They implicitly used a substitution or a transformation to make the denominators more manageable.

Let's go back to the transformed equation:
$$ \frac{1}{2x - 4} + \frac{1}{x - 5} = \frac{1}{2x - 7} + \frac{1}{x - 2} $$
(Correcting the sign based on the original equation). The original equation has a '-' sign on the right side for the last term.
$$ \frac{1}{2x - 4} + \frac{1}{x - 5} = \frac{1}{2x - 7} - \frac{1}{x - 2} $$
Rearranging:
$$ \frac{1}{2x - 4} + \frac{1}{x - 2} = \frac{1}{2x - 7} + \frac{1}{x - 5} $$
Now the sums of constants are indeed equal:
Left side: $(-4) + (-2) = -6$
Right side: $(-7) + (-5) = -12$

There might be a slight misinterpretation of the initial transformation or the problem statement in the presenter's explanation. However, the core idea is to manipulate the terms such that the sum of the constants in the denominators of the grouped terms become equal.

Let's assume the presented method leads to:
$$ \frac{1}{2x-4} + \frac{1}{x-2} = \frac{1}{2x-7} + \frac{1}{x-5} $$
Let $S_1 = -4 + (-2) = -6$ and $S_2 = -7 + (-5) = -12$. Since $S_1 \neq S_2$, this direct grouping doesn't immediately solve it.

However, the presenter's final answer for the first problem was $x = 4.5$. Let's check if this value satisfies the second equation by performing cross-multiplication.

The presenter's method for the first problem is based on the idea that if $\frac{1}{x+a} + \frac{1}{x+b} = \frac{1}{x+c} + \frac{1}{x+d}$ and $a+b = c+d$, then $x = -\frac{a+b+c+d}{4}$.

For Problem 1:
$a=-4, b=-5, c=-3, d=-6$.
$a+b = -9$, $c+d = -9$.
So, $x = - \frac{(-4) + (-5) + (-3) + (-6)}{4} = - \frac{-18}{4} = \frac{18}{4} = 4.5$.

For Problem 2, the equation after simplification is:
$$ \frac{1}{2x - 4} + \frac{1}{x - 5} = \frac{1}{2x - 7} - \frac{1}{x - 2} $$
Let's rewrite this as:
$$ \frac{1}{2(x - 2)} + \frac{1}{x - 5} = \frac{1}{2x - 7} - \frac{1}{x - 2} $$
$$ \frac{1}{2(x - 2)} + \frac{1}{x - 2} = \frac{1}{2x - 7} + \frac{1}{x - 5} $$
$$ \frac{3}{2(x - 2)} = \frac{(x - 5) + (2x - 7)}{(2x - 7)(x - 5)} $$
$$ \frac{3}{2(x - 2)} = \frac{3x - 12}{(2x - 7)(x - 5)} $$
$$ \frac{3}{2(x - 2)} = \frac{3(x - 4)}{(2x - 7)(x - 5)} $$
$$ \frac{1}{2(x - 2)} = \frac{x - 4}{(2x - 7)(x - 5)} $$
$$ (2x - 7)(x - 5) = 2(x - 2)(x - 4) $$
$$ 2x^2 - 10x - 7x + 35 = 2(x^2 - 4x - 2x + 8) $$
$$ 2x^2 - 17x + 35 = 2(x^2 - 6x + 8) $$
$$ 2x^2 - 17x + 35 = 2x^2 - 12x + 16 $$
$$ -17x + 35 = -12x + 16 $$
$$ 35 - 16 = -12x + 17x $$
$$ 19 = 5x $$
$$ x = \frac{19}{5} = 3.8 $$

The presenter's calculation for the second problem resulted in $x=3$. This indicates a potential error in the presenter's derivation or a simplified shortcut not fully explained. The direct algebraic simplification yielded $x=3.8$.

**Key Takeaway:**

The presented technique involves transforming the given equations by rewriting terms to isolate constants and then identifying patterns where the sum of constants in the denominators of grouped terms are equal. This allows for a simplified algebraic solution. It is crucial to correctly apply the algebraic manipulations and to notice the specific structure of the problem.
# 44.Baudhayana Sulbasutra (segment of a circle)
The video is about "Baudhayana Sulbasutra (segment of a circle)". The speaker is explaining a geometry problem related to angles within a circle. Specifically, they are showing how to find unknown angles in a circle when some angles are given.

Here's a breakdown of the angles and calculations shown in the video:

**Given Angles:**
*   Angle at one vertex: 30°
*   Angle at another vertex: 60°
*   Angle at a third vertex: 50°

**The core concept being explained is that angles subtended by the same arc in a circle are equal.** This is a fundamental theorem in circle geometry.

The speaker proceeds to calculate the remaining angles within the inscribed quadrilateral by using this property and the fact that angles on a straight line add up to 180°, and angles in a triangle add up to 180°.

**Calculations shown:**
1.  **First part:** The speaker marks four angles and labels them as W, M, E, and 3.
    *   W is 50°.
    *   M is 30°.
    *   E is calculated as 40° (derived from 180° - 30° - 50° - 60°, which implies a larger triangle or semicircle context not fully shown).
    *   The remaining angle is calculated as 180° - 140° = 40° (where 140° = 30° + 60° + 50°).

2.  **Second part:** The speaker uses the "angles in the same segment are equal" property.
    *   An angle of 50° is shown, and the opposite angle is identified as also 50°.
    *   An angle of 30° is shown, and the opposite angle is identified as also 30°.
    *   An angle of 60° is shown, and the opposite angle is identified as also 60°.
    *   The last angle is calculated as 40° (180° - 30° - 60° - 50° = 40°).

The video demonstrates a practical application of these geometric principles, likely for students preparing for exams like SSC or similar competitive tests. The mention of Baudhayana Sulbasutra indicates a historical context for these geometric rules.

**VEDIC MATHEMATICS**
## Topic 1: Adyamadyenantya Mantyena: Quadratic Equation Factoring Trick

This Vedic mathematics trick, "Adyamadyenantya Mantyena" (first by the first, last by the last), offers a quick method to factor quadratic expressions of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$.

*How it works:*

1.  **Multiply the first and last coefficients:** Multiply the coefficient of $x^2$ (let's call it $a$) by the constant term (let's call it $c$). This product becomes your "multiplication target."
    *   Example 1: For $8x^2 + 26x + 15$, multiply $8 \times 15 = 120$.
    *   Example 2: For $4x^2 + 23x + 15$, multiply $4 \times 15 = 60$.

2.  **Identify the middle coefficient:** This is the coefficient of $x$ (let's call it $b$). This becomes your "addition target."
    *   Example 1: For $8x^2 + 26x + 15$, the addition target is $26$.
    *   Example 2: For $4x^2 + 23x + 15$, the addition target is $23$.

3.  **Find two numbers:** Find two numbers that multiply to the "multiplication target" (from step 1) and add up to the "addition target" (from step 2).
    *   Example 1: For $120$ (multiply) and $26$ (add), the numbers are $20$ and $6$ (since $20 \times 6 = 120$ and $20 + 6 = 26$).
    *   Example 2: For $60$ (multiply) and $23$ (add), the numbers are $20$ and $3$ (since $20 \times 3 = 60$ and $20 + 3 = 23$).

4.  **Form the first factor:**
    *   Take the constant term of the original quadratic ($c$) and place it as the numerator.
    *   Take the larger of the two numbers found in step 3 (let's call it $p$) and place it as the denominator.
    *   Simplify this fraction.
    *   Multiply the denominator by 'x' and add the numerator. This forms your first factor.
    *   Example 1:
        *   $c = 15$, $p = 20$. Fraction: $\frac{15}{20}$.
        *   Simplify: $\frac{3}{4}$.
        *   First factor: $(4x + 3)$.
    *   Example 2:
        *   $c = 15$, $p = 20$. Fraction: $\frac{15}{20}$.
        *   Simplify: $\frac{3}{4}$.
        *   First factor: $(4x + 3)$.

5.  **Form the second factor:**
    *   Take the coefficient of $x^2$ (let's call it $a$) and place it as the numerator, along with $x^2$.
    *   Take the denominator from your first factor (the coefficient of $x$, which was the denominator of the simplified fraction from step 4, let's call it $d_1$) and place it as the denominator, along with $x$.
    *   Divide these terms. The result will be the 'x' term for the second factor.
    *   Take the constant term of the original quadratic ($c$) and place it as the numerator.
    *   Take the numerator from your first factor (the constant added to $x$, which was the numerator of the simplified fraction from step 4, let's call it $n_1$) and place it as the denominator.
    *   Divide these terms. The result will be the constant term for the second factor.
    *   Combine these two results to form the second factor.

    *   Example 1: For $8x^2 + 26x + 15$:
        *   First factor: $(4x + 3)$.
        *   Divide $8x^2$ by $4x$: $\frac{8x^2}{4x} = 2x$.
        *   Divide $15$ by $3$: $\frac{15}{3} = 5$.
        *   Second factor: $(2x + 5)$.
        *   *Final Factorization:* $(4x + 3)(2x + 5)$.

    *   Example 2: For $4x^2 + 23x + 15$:
        *   First factor: $(4x + 3)$.
        *   Divide $4x^2$ by $4x$: $\frac{4x^2}{4x} = x$.
        *   Divide $15$ by $3$: $\frac{15}{3} = 5$.
        *   Second factor: $(x + 5)$.
        *   *Final Factorization:* $(4x + 3)(x + 5)$.

*Key Points:*

*   This trick helps to factor quadratic expressions quickly without relying on traditional trial-and-error methods or the quadratic formula.
*   It's particularly useful in competitive exams where speed is crucial.
*   The "Adyamadyenantya Mantyena" principle is about using the first and last terms to derive the intermediate steps.
*   Practice is key to mastering this and other Vedic math tricks.


## Topic 2: ANTYAYOREVA (Solving Simple Equations with Ratios)

The Vedic Sutra "ANTYAYOREVA" means "only the last terms". This trick is useful in solving simple equations where the numerator and denominator on the left-hand side (L.H.S.) bearing the independent terms stand in the same ratio to each other as the entire numerator and the entire denominator of the right-hand side (R.H.S.) stand to each other.

### How it Works:

1.  **Identify the relationship between L.H.S. and R.H.S.:** The core idea is to observe if the left-hand side of the equation can be manipulated into a form where a common factor, when multiplied by a term, results in a structure similar to the right-hand side. Specifically, look for cases where, after factoring out 'x' (or the variable), the remaining binomial terms in both the numerator and denominator on the L.H.S. match the numerator and denominator of the R.H.S., respectively. The constant terms on the L.H.S. then form a ratio corresponding to the R.H.S. fraction.

    *   **Given equation pattern:**
        $$ \frac{x^2 + ax + C_1}{x^2 + bx + C_2} = \frac{x + A}{x + B} $$
    *   **Identify the pattern on L.H.S.:**
        The first two terms of the numerator ($x^2 + ax$) can be factored as $x(x + a)$.
        The first two terms of the denominator ($x^2 + bx$) can be factored as $x(x + b)$.
    *   **Relate to R.H.S.:**
        If $a = A$ and $b = B$, then the L.H.S. can be rewritten as:
        $$ \frac{x(x + A) + C_1}{x(x + B) + C_2} $$
        For the ANTYAYOREVA trick to apply, the ratio of the constant terms on the L.H.S. ($C_1/C_2$) must be equal to the ratio of the R.H.S. terms $(x+A)/(x+B)$ after the common factor 'x' is effectively 'canceled out' (though technically we are using proportionality).

2.  **Form the simplified equation:** Once this pattern is identified, you can equate the ratio of the constant terms on the L.H.S. to the R.H.S. directly, or more rigorously, consider the equality of the entire independent terms.

    *   If $\frac{x(x + A) + C_1}{x(x + B) + C_2} = \frac{x + A}{x + B}$, then by the principle of ANTYAYOREVA, we can equate the independent terms' ratio to the given ratio:
        $$ \frac{C_1}{C_2} = \frac{x + A}{x + B} $$
        This simplifies the equation significantly.

3.  **Solve the resulting linear equation:** Cross-multiply the simplified equation and solve for 'x'.

### Example from the video:

*   **Problem:**
    $$ \frac{x^2 + 2x + 7}{x^2 + 3x + 5} = \frac{x + 2}{x + 3} $$

*   **Step 1: Identify the relationship.**
    *   **L.H.S. numerator:** $x^2 + 2x + 7 = x(x + 2) + 7$
    *   **L.H.S. denominator:** $x^2 + 3x + 5 = x(x + 3) + 5$
    *   **R.H.S. numerator:** $x + 2$
    *   **R.H.S. denominator:** $x + 3$

    Notice that the terms $(x+2)$ and $(x+3)$ appear in both the factored form of the L.H.S. and the R.H.S. The remaining constant terms on the L.H.S. are 7 and 5.

*   **Step 2: Form the simplified equation.**
    Based on the ANTYAYOREVA principle, we can equate the ratio of the independent terms (constants) from the L.H.S. to the R.H.S.:
    $$ \frac{x + 2}{x + 3} = \frac{7}{5} $$

*   **Step 3: Solve the resulting linear equation.**
    Cross-multiply:
    $$ 5(x + 2) = 7(x + 3) $$
    $$ 5x + 10 = 7x + 21 $$
    Rearrange terms to solve for x:
    $$ 10 - 21 = 7x - 5x $$
    $$ -11 = 2x $$
    $$ x = \frac{-11}{2} $$
    $$ x = -5.5 $$

### Key Points:

*   This trick is specifically applicable when the terms formed by factoring out 'x' from the first two terms of the quadratic expressions on the L.H.S. match the corresponding terms on the R.H.S.
*   The independent constant terms on the L.H.S. then directly form the ratio with the R.H.S. terms.
*   This method significantly simplifies solving complex-looking rational equations by avoiding lengthy algebraic manipulations.

## Topic 3: Incircle of an Equilateral Triangle

This section focuses on finding the radius of an incircle within an equilateral triangle. An **incircle** is a circle inscribed within a polygon such that it is tangent to all sides of the polygon.

*   **Definition:** An incircle is a circle inside a triangle that touches all three sides.
*   **Property:** For an equilateral triangle, all three sides are equal in length.

**Formula for the Inradius ($r$):**

For an equilateral triangle with side length 'a', the radius of its incircle ($r$) is given by the formula:

$$ r = \frac{a}{2\sqrt{3}} $$

**How it works (Examples from the video):**

1.  **Identify the side length ($a$):** The problem will provide the side length of the equilateral triangle.

2.  **Substitute into the formula:** Plug the value of 'a' into the formula $r = \frac{a}{2\sqrt{3}}$.

3.  **Simplify the expression:** Perform any necessary cancellations or rationalizations to get the final answer.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Problem:** Find the radius of the incircle for an equilateral triangle with a side length of $a = 8 \text{ cm}$.
    *   **Solution:**
        $$ r = \frac{8}{2\sqrt{3}} $$
        $$ r = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} \text{ cm} $$
    *   This can also be rationalized by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:
        $$ r = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} \text{ cm} $$

**Key Points:**

*   This formula is specific to **equilateral triangles**.
*   It provides a quick method to find the inradius without complex calculations involving area or geometric constructions.
*   The video mentions this formula is from **Baudhayana Shulbasutra**, an ancient Indian text on mathematics. While not commonly taught in standard textbooks (NCERT or SCERT in India for 10th grade), it is useful for competitive exams like SSC and CGL.

## Topic 4: Circumcircle of an Equilateral Triangle

This section explains how to find the radius of a circumcircle that encloses an equilateral triangle. A **circumcircle** is a circle that passes through all the vertices of a polygon.

*   **Definition:** A circumcircle is a circle that passes through all the vertices of a triangle.
*   **Property:** For an equilateral triangle, all three vertices lie on the circumcircle.

**Formula for the Circumradius ($R$):**

For an equilateral triangle with side length 'a', the radius of its circumcircle ($R$) is given by the formula:

$$ R = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}} $$

**How it works (Examples from the video):**

1.  **Identify the side length ($a$):** The problem will provide the side length of the equilateral triangle.

2.  **Substitute into the formula:** Plug the value of 'a' into the formula $R = \frac{a}{\sqrt{3}}$.

3.  **Simplify the expression:** Perform any necessary cancellations or rationalizations to get the final answer.

*   **Example 1:**
    *   **Problem:** Find the radius of the circumcircle for an equilateral triangle with a side length of $a = 2 \text{ cm}$.
    *   **Solution:**
        $$ R = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \text{ cm} $$
    *   This can also be rationalized by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:
        $$ R = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \text{ cm} $$
    *   The video also mentions that $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73$ for calculation, but for competitive exams, the radical form is usually sufficient.

**Key Points:**

*   This formula is specific to **equilateral triangles**.
*   It provides a direct way to find the circumradius.
*   Similar to the incircle formula, this shortcut is rooted in ancient Indian mathematics (Baudhayana Shulbasutra) and is highly beneficial for competitive exams.
*   Knowing this formula can save significant time compared to traditional geometric methods.

## Topic 5: Algebra Simplification - Vedic Method 2

This method provides a shortcut for simplifying algebraic expressions of the form:

$$ \frac{P}{(x - A)(x - B)} + \frac{Q}{(x - B)(x - C)} + \frac{R}{(x - C)(x - D)} = 0 $$

where $A, B, C, D$ are constants in the denominators, and $P, Q, R$ are constants in the numerators.

The method aims to find the value of $X$ that satisfies the equation.

*How it works:*

The value of $X$ can be found using the following formula:

$$ X = - \left( \frac{PC + QA + RB}{P + Q + R} \right) $$

where:
*   $P, Q, R$ are the numerators of the three terms.
*   $A, B, C, D$ are the constants found in the denominators.
    *   For the first term $\frac{P}{(x-A)(x-B)}$, $A$ and $B$ are the constants.
    *   For the second term $\frac{Q}{(x-B)(x-C)}$, $B$ and $C$ are the constants.
    *   For the third term $\frac{R}{(x-C)(x-D)}$, $C$ and $D$ are the constants.

When applying the formula, ensure to use the absolute values of the constants from the denominators, or carry the negative signs if the factors are $(x+constant)$. In this video's examples, the constants in the terms $x-constant$ or $x+constant$ are directly used.
* $P$ is multiplied by the constant $C$ from $(x-C)$ in the second term.
* $Q$ is multiplied by the constant $A$ from $(x-A)$ in the first term.
* $R$ is multiplied by the constant $B$ from $(x-B)$ in the first or second term.

*Steps to apply the trick:*

1.  *Identify $P, Q, R$ and $A, B, C, D$:*
    *   $P$ is the numerator of the first fraction.
    *   $Q$ is the numerator of the second fraction.
    *   $R$ is the numerator of the third fraction.
    *   $A$ is the constant in $(x-A)$ from the first term.
    *   $B$ is the constant in $(x-B)$ from the first or second term.
    *   $C$ is the constant in $(x-C)$ from the second or third term.
    *   $D$ is the constant in $(x-D)$ from the third term.

2.  *Calculate the numerator component:* $PC + QA + RB$. Be careful with the signs of $A, B, C, D$. If the denominator is $(x-k)$, the constant is $k$. If it's $(x+k)$, the constant is $-k$.

3.  *Calculate the denominator component:* $P + Q + R$.

4.  *Apply the formula:* $X = - \left( \frac{\text{Numerator Component}}{\text{Denominator Component}} \right)$.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{1}{(x-1)(x-3)} + \frac{3}{(x-3)(x-5)} + \frac{5}{(x-5)(x-1)} = 0 $$
    *   Here, $P=1, Q=3, R=5$.
    *   The constants in the denominators are $A=1, B=3, C=5$. Note that the last term uses $(x-1)$ again, so $D=1$.
    *   Constants for cross-multiplication:
        *   $P=1$ corresponds to $A=1, B=3$.
        *   $Q=3$ corresponds to $B=3, C=5$.
        *   $R=5$ corresponds to $C=5, D=1$.

    *   *Applying the formula for the numerator $PC + QA + RB$*:
        *   $P \times C = 1 \times (-5)$ (using the constant associated with $x-C$ in the denominator) $\rightarrow$ The video actually uses $P \times (\text{constant from second factor of third term})$. Let's re-evaluate based on the visual cues in the video.
        *   From the image:
            *   $P=1$, $Q=3$, $R=5$.
            *   Constants in denominators are $a=1, b=3$ (for first term), $b=3, c=5$ (for second term), $c=5, d=1$ (for third term).
            *   The formula shown is $X = - \left( \frac{PC + QA + RB}{P + Q + R} \right)$.
            *   Based on the crossing lines in the video (0:29-0:35):
                *   $P$ is multiplied by $c$ (from $(x-5)$) $\rightarrow 1 \times (-5) = -5$
                *   $Q$ is multiplied by $a$ (from $(x-1)$) $\rightarrow 3 \times (-1) = -3$
                *   $R$ is multiplied by $b$ (from $(x-3)$) $\rightarrow 5 \times (-3) = -15$

    *   Let's re-interpret the formula and constant mapping from the video's example:
        *   $P=1$, $Q=3$, $R=5$.
        *   Denominator factors: $(x-a)(x-b)$, $(x-b)(x-c)$, $(x-c)(x-d)$.
        *   $a=1, b=3, c=5, d=1$.
        *   The formula in the video is $X = - \frac{-(Pa + Qb + Rc)}{P+Q+R}$. This is slightly different from what's written. Let's use the actual calculation from the video:
        *   $P=1$, $Q=3$, $R=5$.
        *   Constants in denominators for cross-multiplication:
            *   $a= -1$ (from $(x-1)$)
            *   $b= -3$ (from $(x-3)$)
            *   $c= -5$ (from $(x-5)$)
            *   $d= -1$ (from $(x-1)$ in the last term)

        *   The video calculation seems to be:
            *   Numerator term $P \times (-5)$ (constant from third term's *first* factor, $(x-5)$) $\rightarrow 1 \times (-5) = -5$
            *   Numerator term $Q \times (-1)$ (constant from first term's *first* factor, $(x-1)$) $\rightarrow 3 \times (-1) = -3$
            *   Numerator term $R \times (-3)$ (constant from second term's *first* factor, $(x-3)$) $\rightarrow 5 \times (-3) = -15$

        *   So, the numerator becomes $-( (-5) + (-3) + (-15) ) = -(-23) = 23$.
        *   Denominator: $P+Q+R = 1+3+5 = 9$.
    *   *Result:* $$ X = \frac{23}{9} $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{2}{(x-1)(x+2)} + \frac{3}{(x+2)(x-4)} + \frac{4}{(x-4)(x-1)} = 0 $$
    *   Here, $P=2, Q=3, R=4$.
    *   Constants for cross-multiplication (as per video's pattern):
        *   $P=2$, the constant from $(x-4)$ in the third term is $-4$. Product $2 \times (-4) = -8$.
        *   $Q=3$, the constant from $(x-1)$ in the first term is $-1$. Product $3 \times (-1) = -3$.
        *   $R=4$, the constant from $(x+2)$ in the second term is $2$. Product $4 \times (2) = 8$.

    *   Numerator (sum of products): $-8 + (-3) + 8 = -3$.
    *   Denominator (sum of numerators): $P+Q+R = 2+3+4 = 9$.
    *   Apply the overall minus sign: $X = - \left( \frac{-3}{9} \right) = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$.
    *   *Result:* $$ X = \frac{1}{3} $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{1}{(x-3)(x-4)} + \frac{3}{(x-4)(x-9)} + \frac{5}{(x-9)(x-3)} = 0 $$
    *   Here, $P=1, Q=3, R=5$.
    *   Constants for cross-multiplication (as per video's pattern):
        *   $P=1$, the constant from $(x-9)$ in the third term is $-9$. Product $1 \times (-9) = -9$.
        *   $Q=3$, the constant from $(x-3)$ in the first term is $-3$. Product $3 \times (-3) = -9$.
        *   $R=5$, the constant from $(x-4)$ in the second term is $-4$. Product $5 \times (-4) = -20$.

    *   Numerator (sum of products): $-9 + (-9) + (-20) = -38$.
    *   Denominator (sum of numerators): $P+Q+R = 1+3+5 = 9$.
    *   Apply the overall minus sign: $X = - \left( \frac{-38}{9} \right) = \frac{38}{9}$.
    *   *Result:* $$ X = \frac{38}{9} $$

*Key Points:*
*   This Vedic method provides a very quick way to solve specific types of algebraic simplification problems, especially those appearing in competitive exams like SSC.
*   The exact pattern for selecting the constants for the numerator's cross-multiplication is crucial and must be memorized. From the video, it appears to be:
    *   $P \times (\text{second constant of the third denominator})$
    *   $Q \times (\text{first constant of the first denominator})$
    *   $R \times (\text{first constant of the second denominator})$
*   All constants $A, B, C, D$ should be taken with their correct signs. For example, in $(x+2)$, the constant is $+2$. In $(x-4)$, the constant is $-4$.
*   The video's formula for the numerator $PC + QA + RB$ is actually $P(\text{constant } D) + Q(\text{constant } A) + R(\text{constant } B)$ from the provided formula $x = -(pc+qa+rb)/(p+q+r)$. It uses $c, a, b$ from the general setup $x = -(pc+qa+rb)/(p+q+r)$ to refer to the denominator constants.
    *   So, $p$ maps to the numerator $P$.
    *   $c$ maps to the constant in the last factor of the *last* denominator (i.e. $D$).
    *   $q$ maps to the numerator $Q$.
    *   $a$ maps to the constant in the first factor of the *first* denominator (i.e. $A$).
    *   $r$ maps to the numerator $R$.
    *   $b$ maps to the constant in the first factor of the *second* denominator (i.e. $B$).
    *   So, the formula is: $X = - \left( \frac{P \times D + Q \times A + R \times B}{P + Q + R} \right)$.
    *   The constants $A, B, D$ are extracted from $(x-A)$, $(x-B)$, $(x-D)$ respectively, which would mean they are $A, B, D$ with their explicit sign.

This trick is particularly useful for quickly finding the value of $X$ without lengthy algebraic manipulation.


## Topic 6: Algebra Simplification - Vedic Method 2

This method provides a shortcut for solving algebraic simplification problems of the form:
$$ \frac{P}{(x+a)(x+b)} + \frac{Q}{(x+b)(x+c)} + \frac{R}{(x+c)(x+d)} = 0 $$

The goal is to find the value of $x$.

*General Formula for x:*
$$ x = - \frac{-(Pc + Qa + Rb)}{(P + Q + R)} $$
*(Note: The formula written on the screen for the general case is slightly different from the way the presenter actually calculates it in the examples. The examples' calculations follow a more consistent pattern that aligns with the trick's intended application. I'll explain based on the examples.)*

*How it works (based on examples):*

1.  *Identify the numerators (P, Q, R):* These are the constant values in the numerator of each fraction.
    *   $P$ is the numerator of the first term.
    *   $Q$ is the numerator of the second term.
    *   $R$ is the numerator of the third term.

2.  *Identify the constants in the denominators (a, b, c, d):* These are the constant values subtracted from 'x' in the denominator factors.
    *   For the first term $\frac{P}{(x-a)(x-b)}$:
        *   $a = $ the first constant (e.g., -1, -3)
        *   $b = $ the second constant (e.g., -3, -5)
    *   For the second term $\frac{Q}{(x-b)(x-c)}$:
        *   $b = $ the first constant (e.g., -3, -5)
        *   $c = $ the second constant (e.g., -5, -1)
    *   For the third term $\frac{R}{(x-c)(x-d)}$:
        *   $c = $ the first constant (e.g., -5, -1)
        *   $d = $ the second constant (e.g., -1, -3)

    *(Important Note on signs):* If the denominator factor is $(x+k)$, then the constant is $-k$. If it's $(x-k)$, the constant is $+k$. The presenter consistently uses the *negative* of the constant from the denominator factors when multiplying. For example, if a factor is $(x-5)$, the constant value used in multiplication is $-5$. If it's $(x+2)$, the constant is $+2$. I will use the actual values present in the denominator factors for clarity, and demonstrate how the signs are handled in the calculation.

3.  *Apply the cross-multiplication pattern for the numerator of $x$ (with a negative sign outside):*
    The numerator of $x$ is given by $-(P \times c + Q \times a + R \times b)$.
    *   $P$ is multiplied by the *second constant* from the *third* denominator ($c$).
    *   $Q$ is multiplied by the *first constant* from the *first* denominator ($a$).
    *   $R$ is multiplied by the *second constant* from the *first* denominator ($b$).

    Visually, imagine drawing lines:
    *   P to c
    *   Q to a
    *   R to b

4.  *Calculate the sum of numerators for the denominator of $x$:*
    The denominator of $x$ is simply $P + Q + R$.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

**Example 1:**
$$ \frac{1}{(x-1)(x-3)} + \frac{3}{(x-3)(x-5)} + \frac{5}{(x-5)(x-1)} = 0 $$
*   Identify P, Q, R: $P=1$, $Q=3$, $R=5$
*   Identify a, b, c, d:
    *   From $(x-1)(x-3)$: $a=-1$, $b=-3$
    *   From $(x-3)(x-5)$: $b=-3$, $c=-5$
    *   From $(x-5)(x-1)$: $c=-5$, $d=-1$

    *(The presenter visually highlights $P=1, Q=3, R=5$ and then $a,b$ under $(x-1)(x-3)$, $b,c$ under $(x-3)(x-5)$, and $c,d$ under $(x-5)(x-1)$. The values he uses for multiplication are the constant terms from these factors, including their signs).*

*   Applying the formula $x = - \frac{-(Pc + Qa + Rb)}{(P + Q + R)}$:
    *   Numerator terms:
        *   $P \times c = 1 \times (-5) = -5$
        *   $Q \times a = 3 \times (-1) = -3$
        *   $R \times b = 5 \times (-3) = -15$
    *   Sum of numerators: $P+Q+R = 1+3+5 = 9$

    $$ x = - \frac{-(1 \times (-5) + 3 \times (-1) + 5 \times (-3))}{(1 + 3 + 5)} $$
    $$ x = - \frac{-(-5 - 3 - 15)}{9} $$
    $$ x = - \frac{-(-23)}{9} $$
    $$ x = - \frac{23}{9} $$
    $$ x = -\frac{23}{9} $$

    *Wait, the video's calculation:* The video states $X = \frac{+5+3+15}{9} = \frac{23}{9}$. This implies that the initial minus sign was handled such that the expression inside the parenthesis was *positive* $Pc+Qa+Rb$ or that all the individual negative products like $-5, -3, -15$ became positive due to an outer minus sign. Let's re-evaluate using the general formula shown: $x = - \frac{-(Pc + Qa + Rb)}{(P + Q + R)}$.
    Let $S = Pc + Qa + Rb$.
    $S = (1 \times -5) + (3 \times -1) + (5 \times -3) = -5 - 3 - 15 = -23$.
    So $x = - \frac{-(-23)}{9} = - \frac{23}{9}$.
    The video calculation for the numerator (01:23) is: $(+5 + 3 + 15)$, which seems to mean that each $P,Q,R$ is multiplied by the *opposite sign* of $a,b,c$. Or that the terms $Pc, Qa, Rb$ are actually $(P \times (-c)), (Q \times (-a)), (R \times (-b))$. This is a common pattern in competitive exams for similar algebra problems.

    Let's *assume* the formula works by taking the constant terms as their absolute values (or if $x+k$ becomes $k$, $x-k$ becomes $-k$) and then using the cross multiplication to generate the terms for the numerator of the expression for $x$.
    From the video's example calculation (01:06 onwards):
    *   $P \times \text{constant related to } c$: $1 \times (-5) = -5$
    *   $Q \times \text{constant related to } a$: $3 \times (-1) = -3$
    *   $R \times \text{constant related to } b$: $5 \times (-3) = -15$
    The numerator before the outside minus sign: $(-5 - 3 - 15) = -23$.
    The equation is $X = - (\text{numerator} / \text{denominator})$.
    So $X = - (-23 / 9) = 23/9$.
    This matches the video's final answer. So the formula effectively becomes:
    $$ x = - \frac{(P \cdot c_3 + Q \cdot c_1 + R \cdot c_2)}{(P + Q + R)} $$
    where $c_1, c_2, c_3$ are the *signed* constants.
    $c_1$ = constant from $(x-a)$ in first term.
    $c_2$ = constant from $(x-b)$ in second term.
    $c_3$ = constant from $(x-c)$ in third term.

    The first example constants are:
    $a_1 = -1$ (from $x-1$)
    $a_2 = -3$ (from $x-3$)
    $b_1 = -3$ (from $x-3$)
    $b_2 = -5$ (from $x-5$)
    $c_1 = -5$ (from $x-5$)
    $c_2 = -1$ (from $x-1$)

    The formula $x = - \frac{-(Pc+Qa+Rb)}{(P+Q+R)}$ means:
    $P=1, Q=3, R=5$
    $a = -1, b=-3, c=-5$ (these are the terms $x-a$, $x-b$, $x-c$ from the main structure).
    $x = - \frac{-(P \cdot c + Q \cdot a + R \cdot b)}{(P+Q+R)}$
    $x = - \frac{-(1 \cdot (-5) + 3 \cdot (-1) + 5 \cdot (-3))}{(1+3+5)}$
    $x = - \frac{-(-5 - 3 - 15)}{9}$
    $x = - \frac{-(-23)}{9} = - \frac{23}{9}$.

    *(Correction: The presenter's final step $X = (+5+3+15)/9$ means he directly multiplies $P$ with $c$ (which is $-5$) but then changes the sign to $+5$. Similarly for others. This is a common pattern where if the expression in the original formula leads to a negative value, the overall value for $x$ becomes positive and vice-versa. Effectively, if the formula gave $x = - (X/Y)$, and $X$ was $-23$, then $x = -(-23/9) = 23/9$. So his calculation for the sum in the numerator is actually $-(Pc+Qa+Rb)$ after all).*

    *   *Result:* $$ x = \frac{23}{9} $$

**Example 2:**
$$ \frac{2}{(x-1)(x+2)} + \frac{3}{(x+2)(x-4)} + \frac{4}{(x-4)(x-1)} = 0 $$
*   Identify P, Q, R: $P=2$, $Q=3$, $R=4$
*   Identify a, b, c, d:
    *   From $(x-1)(x+2)$: $a=-1$, $b=2$
    *   From $(x+2)(x-4)$: $b=2$, $c=-4$
    *   From $(x-4)(x-1)$: $c=-4$, $d=-1$

*   Applying the formula: $x = - \frac{-(Pc + Qa + Rb)}{(P + Q + R)}$
    *   Numerator terms:
        *   $P \times c = 2 \times (-4) = -8$
        *   $Q \times a = 3 \times (-1) = -3$
        *   $R \times b = 4 \times (2) = 8$
    *   Sum of numerators: $P+Q+R = 2+3+4 = 9$

    $$ x = - \frac{-(2 \times (-4) + 3 \times (-1) + 4 \times (2))}{(2 + 3 + 4)} $$
    $$ x = - \frac{-(-8 - 3 + 8)}{9} $$
    $$ x = - \frac{-(-3)}{9} $$
    $$ x = - \frac{-3}{9} $$
    $$ x = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3} $$

    *   *Result:* $$ x = \frac{1}{3} $$

**Example 3:**
$$ \frac{1}{(x-3)(x-4)} + \frac{3}{(x-4)(x-9)} + \frac{5}{(x-9)(x-3)} = 0 $$
*   Identify P, Q, R: $P=1$, $Q=3$, $R=5$
*   Identify a, b, c, d:
    *   From $(x-3)(x-4)$: $a=-3$, $b=-4$
    *   From $(x-4)(x-9)$: $b=-4$, $c=-9$
    *   From $(x-9)(x-3)$: $c=-9$, $d=-3$

*   Applying the formula: $x = - \frac{-(Pc + Qa + Rb)}{(P + Q + R)}$
    *   Numerator terms:
        *   $P \times c = 1 \times (-9) = -9$
        *   $Q \times a = 3 \times (-3) = -9$
        *   $R \times b = 5 \times (-4) = -20$
    *   Sum of numerators: $P+Q+R = 1+3+5 = 9$

    $$ x = - \frac{-(1 \times (-9) + 3 \times (-3) + 5 \times (-4))}{(1 + 3 + 5)} $$
    $$ x = - \frac{-(-9 - 9 - 20)}{9} $$
    $$ x = - \frac{-(-38)}{9} $$
    $$ x = - \frac{38}{9} $$
    $$ x = -\frac{38}{9} $$

    *(Correction: Again, the video's calculation for the numerator (03:26) is $(9+9+20)$ which means $-(Pc+Qa+Rb)$ was evaluated to give positive values. So the final answer matches $-(S)$ not $S$.
    $S = (-9-9-20) = -38$.
    Then $x = -(-38/9) = 38/9$.
    The final answer in the video is $38/9$. So the correct formula from the presenter's calculation is:
    $$ x = \frac{-(P \cdot c + Q \cdot a + R \cdot b)}{(P + Q + R)} $$
    where $a, b, c$ are the *signed* constants of the *third* term of the denominator products $(x-c)$.
    More precisely, the constants associated with the cross-multiplication:
    $x = \frac{-(P \cdot \text{constant from final denominator's last factor (d)} + Q \cdot \text{constant from first denominator's first factor (a)} + R \cdot \text{constant from second denominator's first factor (b)})}{(P+Q+R)}$
    This interpretation would align with the presenter's calculations better if $d$ was used instead of $c$ in the first term's multiplication. Let's recheck the first example.
    $P=1, Q=3, R=5$. Denominator factors are $(x-1), (x-3), (x-5)$.
    $a=-1, b=-3, c=-5$.
    First example video calculation: $1 \times (-5)$ (where $-5$ is $c$), $3 \times (-1)$ (where $-1$ is $a$), $5 \times (-3)$ (where $-3$ is $b$).
    This means the formula as written on screen is:
    $x = - \frac{-(Pc + Qa + Rb)}{(P+Q+R)}$.
    For Example 1: $P=1, Q=3, R=5$. $a=-1, b=-3, c=-5$.
    $x = - \frac{-(1(-5) + 3(-1) + 5(-3))}{1+3+5} = - \frac{-(-5-3-15)}{9} = - \frac{-(-23)}{9} = - \frac{23}{9}$.
    The video calculation for numerator terms (01:23) is: $+5+3+15$. This means the term inside the parenthesis $-(Pc+Qa+Rb)$ evaluates to $+23$.
    For example 3: $P=1, Q=3, R=5$. $a=-3, b=-4, c=-9$.
    $x = - \frac{-(1(-9) + 3(-3) + 5(-4))}{1+3+5} = - \frac{-(-9-9-20)}{9} = - \frac{-(-38)}{9} = - \frac{38}{9}$.
    The video calculation for numerator terms (03:26) is: $+9+9+20$. This means the term inside the parenthesis $-(Pc+Qa+Rb)$ evaluates to $+38$.

    So the formula derived from the calculations is simpler than what's written on screen.
    **Effective Formula as calculated by the presenter:**
    $$ x = \frac{|P \cdot c + Q \cdot a + R \cdot b|}{(P + Q + R)} \quad \text{if all products are negative initially, or otherwise change signs to match.} $$
    This is effectively:
    $$ x = \frac{(-P \cdot c_3) + (-Q \cdot c_1) + (-R \cdot c_2)}{P+Q+R} $$
    where $c_1, c_2, c_3$ are the *signed* constants in the denominators (e.g., $(x-1)$ implies $c_x=-1$, $(x+2)$ implies $c_x=2$).

    Let's re-state the specific constants used in the presenter's multiplication for each term to be unambiguous:
    *   $P$ is multiplied by the constant from the factor common to the *third and second* denominators (i.e., $x+c$ from the third term or $x+c$ from the second term).
    *   $Q$ is multiplied by the constant from the factor common to the *first and third* denominators (i.e., $x+a$ from the first term or $x+d$ from the third term).
    *   $R$ is multiplied by the constant from the factor common to the *first and second* denominators (i.e., $x+b$ from the first term or $x+b$ from the second term).

    *Example 1 Constants:* $P=1, Q=3, R=5$. Factors: $(x-1), (x-3), (x-5)$.
    *   $P \times (-5)$ (constant from $(x-5)$) = $-5$
    *   $Q \times (-1)$ (constant from $(x-1)$) = $-3$
    *   $R \times (-3)$ (constant from $(x-3)$) = $-15$
    The sum is $(-5-3-15) = -23$.
    The overall sign of $x$ is the negative of this sum divided by the sum of numerators: $-(-23)/9 = 23/9$.

    *Example 2 Constants:* $P=2, Q=3, R=4$. Factors: $(x-1), (x+2), (x-4)$.
    *   $P \times (-4)$ (constant from $(x-4)$) = $-8$
    *   $Q \times (-1)$ (constant from $(x-1)$) = $-3$
    *   $R \times (2)$ (constant from $(x+2)$) = $8$
    The sum is $(-8-3+8) = -3$.
    The overall sign of $x$ is the negative of this sum divided by the sum of numerators: $-(-3)/9 = 3/9 = 1/3$.

    *Example 3 Constants:* $P=1, Q=3, R=5$. Factors: $(x-3), (x-4), (x-9)$.
    *   $P \times (-9)$ (constant from $(x-9)$) = $-9$
    *   $Q \times (-3)$ (constant from $(x-3)$) = $-9$
    *   $R \times (-4)$ (constant from $(x-4)$) = $-20$
    The sum is $(-9-9-20) = -38$.
    The overall sign of $x$ is the negative of this sum divided by the sum of numerators: $-(-38)/9 = 38/9$.

    This consistent interpretation aligns perfectly with the presenter's verbal and written calculations.
    *   *Result:* $$ x = \frac{38}{9} $$

*Key Points:*

*   This Vedic method provides a quick way to solve specific algebraic simplification problems where three fractional terms sum to zero, and the denominators have specific overlapping linear factors.
*   The key is to correctly identify the numerators (P, Q, R) and the constant terms (including their signs) from the denominator factors.
*   The formula for $x$ involves a specific cross-multiplication pattern for the numerator and a simple sum for the denominator.
*   This trick is particularly useful in competitive exams like SSC.


## Topic 7: Baudhayana Shulbasutra (Trigonometry Values)

This Vedic trick, based on the Baudhayana Shulbasutra, helps in calculating trigonometric values for angles beyond the standard 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°. It uses a method similar to compound angle formulas in modern trigonometry.

**Key Idea:**
The method uses two right-angled triangles with known angles (A and B) and their corresponding side ratios (base B, altitude A, and hypotenuse H). By combining these two triangles, we can derive the trigonometric values for the sum of their angles (A+B).

**Input Data (from known triangles):**

We need two right-angled triangles. For each triangle, we identify:
*   **Angle:** A or B
*   **Base:** B1 (for angle A), B2 (for angle B)
*   **Altitude (Opposite Side):** A1 (for angle A), A2 (for angle B)
*   **Hypotenuse:** h1 (for angle A), h2 (for angle B)

**Table of Relationships:**

| Angle | Base (B) | Altitude (A) | Hypotenuse (h) |
| :---- | :------- | :----------- | :------------- |
| A     | B1       | A1           | h1             |
| B     | B2       | A2           | h2             |
| **A+B** | **b1b2 - a1a2** | **b2a1 + a2b1** | **h1h2**         |

**Deriving Trigonometric Values for (A+B):**

Once we calculate the new Base, Altitude, and Hypotenuse for the angle (A+B) using the formulas above, we can find any trigonometric ratio (sine, cosine, tangent, etc.) for (A+B).

*   **Sine (A+B):** Opposite / Hypotenuse = (b2a1 + a2b1) / (h1h2)
*   **Cosine (A+B):** Adjacent / Hypotenuse = (b1b2 - a1a2) / (h1h2)
*   **Tangent (A+B):** Opposite / Adjacent = (b2a1 + a2b1) / (b1b2 - a1a2)

**Example from the Video: Finding sin(105°), cos(105°), tan(105°)**

We want to find the trigonometric values for 105°. We can express 105° as the sum of two standard angles: 60° + 45°.

1.  **Identify Known Triangle Values:**
    *   **For A = 60°:**
        *   Base (B1) = 1
        *   Altitude (A1) = √3
        *   Hypotenuse (h1) = 2
    *   **For B = 45°:**
        *   Base (B2) = 1
        *   Altitude (A2) = 1
        *   Hypotenuse (h2) = √2

2.  **Calculate New Base, Altitude, and Hypotenuse for (A+B) = 105°:**
    *   **New Base (b1b2 - a1a2):** (1 * 1) - (√3 * 1) = 1 - √3
    *   **New Altitude (b2a1 + a2b1):** (1 * √3) + (1 * 1) = √3 + 1
    *   **New Hypotenuse (h1h2):** (2 * √2) = 2√2

3.  **Calculate Trigonometric Values for 105°:**

    *   **sin(105°):** (New Altitude) / (New Hypotenuse)
        $$ \sin(105^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{2\sqrt{2}} $$

    *   **cos(105°):** (New Base) / (New Hypotenuse)
        $$ \cos(105^\circ) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{2}} $$

    *   **tan(105°):** (New Altitude) / (New Base)
        $$ \tan(105^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{1 - \sqrt{3}} $$

**Advantages:**

*   This method allows you to calculate trigonometric values for a wide range of angles (sums and differences of known angles) by simply knowing the ratios for basic angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°).
*   It effectively provides a systematic way to derive compound angle formulas without explicit memorization of those formulas.
*   By learning just the values for the 5 basic angles, one can derive values for about 100 different angles.

**Note:** The video implies that the specific "Speed Maths" class mentioned contains a trick for memorizing the basic trigonometric values (0, 30, 45, 60, 90 degrees), which serves as the foundation for applying this Baudhayana Shulbasutra trick.


## Topic 8: Lopana Sthapanabhyam

This trick, derived from Vedic Mathematics and referred to as "Lopana Sthapanabhyam," means "by alternate elimination and retention." It's used to factorize complex quadratic expressions involving multiple variables, often of the form $(a+b+c)^2$. This method is particularly useful for competitive exams like NEET, SSC CGL, and similar entrance exams where quick factorization is required.

**The Concept:**

The "Lopana Sthapanabhyam" method involves systematically eliminating one variable at a time from the given quadratic expression to obtain simpler quadratic expressions in two variables. These simpler expressions are then factored, and the resulting factors are combined to form the complete factorization of the original multi-variable expression.

**How it Works (Step-by-Step with Examples):**

Let's illustrate the method with two examples.

### Example 1: Factoring $3x^2 + 7xy + 2y^2 + 11xz + 7yz + 6z^2$

**Problem:** Factorize the expression: $3x^2 + 7xy + 2y^2 + 11xz + 7yz + 6z^2$

**Steps:**

1.  **Eliminate 'z' (by setting z=0):**
    *   Remove all terms containing 'z'. The expression becomes:
        $3x^2 + 7xy + 2y^2$
    *   Factorize this quadratic expression in 'x' and 'y'.
        *   We need two binomials $(Ax + By)(Cx + Dy)$ such that when multiplied, they yield the expression.
        *   For $3x^2$, we can use $(3x)$ and $(x)$.
        *   For $2y^2$, we can use $(y)$ and $(2y)$.
        *   Let's try $(3x + y)(x + 2y)$.
        *   Expanding this: $3x(x) + 3x(2y) + y(x) + y(2y) = 3x^2 + 6xy + xy + 2y^2 = 3x^2 + 7xy + 2y^2$.
    *   So, the factors are $(3x + y)$ and $(x + 2y)$.

2.  **Eliminate 'y' (by setting y=0):**
    *   Remove all terms containing 'y'. The expression becomes:
        $3x^2 + 11xz + 6z^2$
    *   Factorize this quadratic expression in 'x' and 'z'.
        *   For $3x^2$, we can use $(3x)$ and $(x)$.
        *   For $6z^2$, we can use $(2z)$ and $(3z)$.
        *   Let's try $(3x + 2z)(x + 3z)$.
        *   Expanding this: $3x(x) + 3x(3z) + 2z(x) + 2z(3z) = 3x^2 + 9xz + 2xz + 6z^2 = 3x^2 + 11xz + 6z^2$.
    *   So, the factors are $(3x + 2z)$ and $(x + 3z)$.

3.  **Combine the factors:**
    *   From Step 1, we have $(3x + y)$ and $(x + 2y)$.
    *   From Step 2, we have $(3x + 2z)$ and $(x + 3z)$.
    *   Notice that $3x$ and $x$ appear in both sets of factors. We need to pair the remaining terms consistently.
    *   Let's form two complete factors:
        *   **Factor 1:** Start with $(3x + y)$ from Step 1. The corresponding 'z' term from the factor containing $3x$ in Step 2 is $+2z$. So, Factor 1 is $(3x + y + 2z)$.
        *   **Factor 2:** Start with $(x + 2y)$ from Step 1. The corresponding 'z' term from the factor containing $x$ in Step 2 is $+3z$. So, Factor 2 is $(x + 2y + 3z)$.

**Final Factorization:**
$(3x + y + 2z)(x + 2y + 3z)$

### Example 2: Factoring $12x^2 + 11xy + 2y^2 - 13xz - 7yz + 3z^2$

**Problem:** Factorize the expression: $12x^2 + 11xy + 2y^2 - 13xz - 7yz + 3z^2$

**Steps:**

1.  **Eliminate 'z' (by setting z=0):**
    *   Remove all terms containing 'z'. The expression becomes:
        $12x^2 + 11xy + 2y^2$
    *   Factorize this quadratic expression in 'x' and 'y'.
        *   For $12x^2$, we can use $(3x)$ and $(4x)$.
        *   For $2y^2$, we can use $(2y)$ and $(y)$.
        *   Let's try $(3x + 2y)(4x + y)$.
        *   Expanding this: $3x(4x) + 3x(y) + 2y(4x) + 2y(y) = 12x^2 + 3xy + 8xy + 2y^2 = 12x^2 + 11xy + 2y^2$.
    *   So, the factors are $(3x + 2y)$ and $(4x + y)$.

2.  **Eliminate 'y' (by setting y=0):**
    *   Remove all terms containing 'y'. The expression becomes:
        $12x^2 - 13xz + 3z^2$
    *   Factorize this quadratic expression in 'x' and 'z'.
        *   For $12x^2$, we can use $(4x)$ and $(3x)$.
        *   For $3z^2$, we need terms that multiply to $+3z^2$ but combine with the 'x' terms to give $-13xz$. So, we can use $(-3z)$ and $(-z)$.
        *   Let's try $(4x - 3z)(3x - z)$.
        *   Expanding this: $4x(3x) + 4x(-z) - 3z(3x) - 3z(-z) = 12x^2 - 4xz - 9xz + 3z^2 = 12x^2 - 13xz + 3z^2$.
    *   So, the factors are $(4x - 3z)$ and $(3x - z)$.

3.  **Combine the factors:**
    *   From Step 1, we have $(3x + 2y)$ and $(4x + y)$.
    *   From Step 2, we have $(4x - 3z)$ and $(3x - z)$.
    *   Let's form two complete factors:
        *   **Factor 1:** Start with $(3x + 2y)$ from Step 1. The corresponding 'z' term from the factor containing $3x$ in Step 2 is $-z$. So, Factor 1 is $(3x + 2y - z)$.
        *   **Factor 2:** Start with $(4x + y)$ from Step 1. The corresponding 'z' term from the factor containing $4x$ in Step 2 is $-3z$. So, Factor 2 is $(4x + y - 3z)$.

**Final Factorization:**
$(3x + 2y - z)(4x + y - 3z)$

**Key Points for Lopana Sthapanabhyam:**

*   This method is primarily useful for quadratic expressions in three variables, especially when they can be factored into two linear expressions.
*   The terms of the original expression are rearranged and grouped based on the variable being eliminated.
*   Careful factorization of the resulting two-variable quadratics is crucial.
*   Pay attention to the signs of the terms when combining the factors. If the constant term in the eliminated-variable expression is positive, and the middle term is negative, both constant parts of the factors should be negative (as seen in Example 2 for $3z^2$).
*   Practice with various examples is key to mastering this technique.


## Topic 9: CALANA KALANABHYAM

This trick, derived from Vedic Mathematics, is designed to efficiently find the roots of quadratic equations and can also be applied to differential calculus problems for factorizing expressions of higher degrees. The term "Calana Kalanabhyam" translates to "Sequential motion."

### Application for Quadratic Equations

The primary use demonstrated here is finding the roots (solutions for $x$) of a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

*How it works (using the provided examples):*

1.  **Identify coefficients:** For a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, identify the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.

2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($b^2 - 4ac$):** This value is crucial for the trick.
    *   Example 1: For $7x^2 - 11x - 7 = 0$, $a=7, b=-11, c=-7$.
        *   $b^2 - 4ac = (-11)^2 - 4(7)(-7) = 121 - (-196) = 121 + 196 = 317$.
    *   Example 2: For $x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0$, $a=1, b=-2, c=-4$.
        *   $b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(-4) = 4 - (-16) = 4 + 16 = 20$.
    *   Example 3: For $x^2 - 3x - 10 = 0$, $a=1, b=-3, c=-10$.
        *   $b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4(1)(-10) = 9 - (-40) = 9 + 40 = 49$.

3.  **Form the simplified equation:** Construct an expression in the form $2ax + b = \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$.
    *   Example 1: For $7x^2 - 11x - 7 = 0$:
        *   $2(7)x + (-11) = \pm \sqrt{317}$
        *   $14x - 11 = \pm \sqrt{317}$

    *   Example 2: For $x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0$:
        *   $2(1)x + (-2) = \pm \sqrt{20}$
        *   $2x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{20}$

    *   Example 3: For $x^2 - 3x - 10 = 0$:
        *   $2(1)x + (-3) = \pm \sqrt{49}$
        *   $2x - 3 = \pm \sqrt{49}$

4.  **Solve for x:** Isolate $x$ using basic algebraic operations.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1: $7x^2 - 11x - 7 = 0$**
    *   Coefficients: $a=7, b=-11, c=-7$
    *   $b^2 - 4ac = 317$
    *   Simplified Equation: $14x - 11 = \pm \sqrt{317}$
    *   This is the final form presented in the video without solving for $x$.

*   **Example 2: $x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0$**
    *   Coefficients: $a=1, b=-2, c=-4$
    *   $b^2 - 4ac = 20$
    *   Simplified Equation: $2x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{20}$
    *   Simplify $\sqrt{20} = \sqrt{4 \times 5} = 2\sqrt{5}$.
    *   So, $2x - 2 = \pm 2\sqrt{5}$
    *   Divide by 2: $x - 1 = \pm \sqrt{5}$
    *   Solve for $x$: $x = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}$
        *   Solution 1: $x = 1 + \sqrt{5}$
        *   Solution 2: $x = 1 - \sqrt{5}$

*   **Example 3: $x^2 - 3x - 10 = 0$**
    *   Coefficients: $a=1, b=-3, c=-10$
    *   $b^2 - 4ac = 49$
    *   Simplified Equation: $2x - 3 = \pm \sqrt{49}$
    *   Simplify $\sqrt{49} = 7$.
    *   So, $2x - 3 = \pm 7$
    *   **Case 1: Positive root**
        *   $2x - 3 = 7$
        *   $2x = 7 + 3$
        *   $2x = 10$
        *   $x = \frac{10}{2} = 5$
    *   **Case 2: Negative root**
        *   $2x - 3 = -7$
        *   $2x = -7 + 3$
        *   $2x = -4$
        *   $x = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$
    *   Solutions: $x=5$ or $x=-2$.

### Key Points:

*   This Vedic Math trick provides a streamlined way to find the roots of quadratic equations.
*   It simplifies the process into a few algebraic steps after calculating the discriminant.
*   The trick is also mentioned as applicable for factoring expressions in differential calculus for 3rd, 4th, and 5th-degree polynomials, connecting it to the concept of "sequential motion."
*   Practicing this method can significantly improve speed and efficiency in solving such problems.


## Topic 10: Lopana Sthapanabhyam (Factorization)

The Vedic Maths Sutra "Lopana Sthapanabhyam" translates to "by alternate elimination and retention." This trick is particularly useful for factorization, especially for quadratic expressions in multiple variables, which can appear in competitive exams like SSC CGL and NEET.

*How it works (for expressions like $ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dxz + eyz + fz^2$):*

The core idea is to eliminate one variable at a time and factorize the remaining expression, then combine the factors to get the final factorization.

**Steps:**

1.  **Eliminate the 'z' terms:**
    *   Temporarily remove all terms containing 'z' (e.g., $dxz$, $eyz$, $fz^2$).
    *   Factorize the remaining quadratic expression in 'x' and 'y' (e.g., $ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$). This will give two linear factors.
    *   *Example 1:* For $3x^2 + 7xy + 2y^2 + 11xz + 7yz + 6z^2$, eliminate 'z' terms.
        *   Remaining expression: $3x^2 + 7xy + 2y^2$.
        *   Factorization: $(3x + y)(x + 2y)$.

2.  **Eliminate the 'y' terms:**
    *   Temporarily remove all terms containing 'y' (e.g., $bxy$, $cy^2$, $eyz$).
    *   Factorize the remaining quadratic expression in 'x' and 'z' (e.g., $ax^2 + dxz + fz^2$). This will give two linear factors.
    *   *Example 1:* For $3x^2 + 7xy + 2y^2 + 11xz + 7yz + 6z^2$, eliminate 'y' terms.
        *   Remaining expression: $3x^2 + 11xz + 6z^2$.
        *   Factorization: $(3x + 2z)(x + 3z)$.

3.  **Combine the factors:**
    *   Identify the common patterns in the factors obtained from steps 1 and 2.
    *   From the factors of step 1, take one factor (e.g., $(3x + y)$).
    *   From the factors of step 2, take one factor that starts with the 'x' term corresponding to the chosen factor from step 1 (e.g., $(3x + 2z)$).
    *   Combine these chosen factors by including all three variables (x, y, z), ensuring the constant terms align to reproduce the original expression.

*Example 1:*
*   **Problem:** Factorize $3x^2 + 7xy + 2y^2 + 11xz + 7yz + 6z^2$
*   **Step 1 (Eliminate 'z'):**
    *   $3x^2 + 7xy + 2y^2$
    *   Factors: $(3x + y)$ and $(x + 2y)$
*   **Step 2 (Eliminate 'y'):**
    *   $3x^2 + 11xz + 6z^2$
    *   Factors: $(3x + 2z)$ and $(x + 3z)$
*   **Step 3 (Combine):**
    *   We choose $(3x + y)$ from Step 1 and $(3x + 2z)$ from Step 2.
    *   Combining terms with 'x', 'y', and 'z' from these factors:
        *   First factor: $(3x + y + 2z)$
        *   Second factor: $(x + 2y + 3z)$
    *   *Result:* $(3x + y + 2z)(x + 2y + 3z)$

*Example 2:*
*   **Problem:** Factorize $12x^2 + 11xy + 2y^2 - 13xz - 7yz + 3z^2$
*   **Step 1 (Eliminate 'z'):**
    *   $12x^2 + 11xy + 2y^2$
    *   Factors: $(3x + 2y)$ and $(4x + y)$
*   **Step 2 (Eliminate 'y'):**
    *   $12x^2 - 13xz + 3z^2$
    *   Factors: $(4x - 3z)$ and $(3x - z)$
*   **Step 3 (Combine):**
    *   We choose $(3x + 2y)$ from Step 1 and $(3x - z)$ from Step 2.
    *   Combining terms:
        *   First factor: $(3x + 2y - z)$
        *   Second factor: $(4x + y - 3z)$
    *   *Result:* $(3x + 2y - z)(4x + y - 3z)$

**Key Points:**
*   This trick helps to quickly find the factors of complex quadratic expressions in multiple variables.
*   The "elimination and retention" principle simplifies the problem into more manageable parts.
*   Practice with various examples is crucial to master this technique.

I can help you with that! The video you provided is about a method called "Lopana Sthapanabhyam" for finding the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of algebraic expressions.

Here's a breakdown of the method, as explained in the video:

## Topic 11: HCF  (Lopana Sthapanabhyam Method)

This method, called **Lopana Sthapanabhyam**, is used to find the HCF of two or more algebraic expressions (polynomials).

*How it works:*

1.  **Identify the expressions:** You are given two or more algebraic expressions.
    *   Example 1:
        *   Expression 1: $$ 4x^3 + 13x^2 + 19x + 4 $$
        *   Expression 2: $$ 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 5x - 4 $$
    *   Example 2:
        *   Expression 1: $$ x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12 $$
        *   Expression 2: $$ x^3 - 7x^2 + 16x - 12 $$

2.  **Align and equalize the leading terms (if necessary):** Write the expressions one below the other. The goal is to make the leading term (the term with the highest power of 'x') of the lower expression equal to the leading term of the upper expression. If they are not equal, multiply the entire lower expression by a suitable constant.
    *   Example 1:
        *   Expression 1 (upper): $$ 4x^3 + 13x^2 + 19x + 4 $$
        *   Expression 2 (lower): $$ 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 5x - 4 $$
        *   The leading term of Expression 1 is $4x^3$, and for Expression 2 it is $2x^3$. To make them equal, multiply Expression 2 by 2.
        *   Multiplied Expression 2: $$ 2(2x^3 + 5x^2 + 5x - 4) = 4x^3 + 10x^2 + 10x - 8 $$
    *   Example 2:
        *   Expression 1 (upper): $$ x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12 $$
        *   Expression 2 (lower): $$ x^3 - 7x^2 + 16x - 12 $$
        *   The leading terms are already equal ($x^3$), so no multiplication is needed.

3.  **Change signs and add:** Change the sign of each term in the lower expression (the one you potentially multiplied) and then add the two expressions together. This step is equivalent to subtracting the lower expression from the upper one.
    *   Example 1 (continuing from step 2):
        *   Expression 1: $$ 4x^3 + 13x^2 + 19x + 4 $$
        *   Multiplied Expression 2 with signs changed: $$ -4x^3 - 10x^2 - 10x + 8 $$
        *   Add them:
            *   $(4x^3 - 4x^3) = 0$
            *   $(13x^2 - 10x^2) = 3x^2$
            *   $(19x - 10x) = 9x$
            *   $(4 + 8) = 12$
        *   Result of addition: $$ 3x^2 + 9x + 12 $$
    *   Example 2 (continuing from step 2):
        *   Expression 1: $$ x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12 $$
        *   Expression 2 with signs changed: $$ -x^3 + 7x^2 - 16x + 12 $$
        *   Add them:
            *   $(x^3 - x^3) = 0$
            *   $(-3x^2 + 7x^2) = 4x^2$
            *   $(-4x - 16x) = -20x$
            *   $(12 + 12) = 24$
        *   Result of addition: $$ 4x^2 - 20x + 24 $$

4.  **Simplify the resulting expression:** If the resulting expression has common factors (numerical coefficients), divide the entire expression by the greatest common factor of its coefficients.
    *   Example 1 (continuing from step 3):
        *   Result: $$ 3x^2 + 9x + 12 $$
        *   The coefficients are 3, 9, and 12. Their greatest common factor is 3.
        *   Divide by 3: $$ \frac{3x^2 + 9x + 12}{3} = x^2 + 3x + 4 $$
        *   This simplified expression is the HCF.
    *   Example 2 (continuing from step 3):
        *   Result: $$ 4x^2 - 20x + 24 $$
        *   The coefficients are 4, -20, and 24. Their greatest common factor is 4.
        *   Divide by 4: $$ \frac{4x^2 - 20x + 24}{4} = x^2 - 5x + 6 $$
        *   This simplified expression is the HCF.


*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: Find the HCF of $4x^3 + 13x^2 + 19x + 4$ and $2x^3 + 5x^2 + 5x - 4$.
    *   Step 1: Write expressions.
        $$ P_1(x) = 4x^3 + 13x^2 + 19x + 4 $$
        $$ P_2(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 + 5x - 4 $$
    *   Step 2: Equalize leading terms. Multiply $P_2(x)$ by 2.
        $$ 2 \cdot P_2(x) = 4x^3 + 10x^2 + 10x - 8 $$
    *   Step 3: Change signs of multiplied $P_2(x)$ and add to $P_1(x)$.
        $$ (4x^3 + 13x^2 + 19x + 4) + (-4x^3 - 10x^2 - 10x + 8) $$
        $$ = (4-4)x^3 + (13-10)x^2 + (19-10)x + (4+8) $$
        $$ = 0x^3 + 3x^2 + 9x + 12 $$
        $$ = 3x^2 + 9x + 12 $$
    *   Step 4: Simplify the result by dividing by common factor (3).
        $$ \frac{3x^2 + 9x + 12}{3} = x^2 + 3x + 4 $$
    *   **HCF:** $$ x^2 + 3x + 4 $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: Find the HCF of $x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12$ and $x^3 - 7x^2 + 16x - 12$.
    *   Step 1: Write expressions.
        $$ P_1(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12 $$
        $$ P_2(x) = x^3 - 7x^2 + 16x - 12 $$
    *   Step 2: Leading terms are already equal ($x^3$).
    *   Step 3: Change signs of $P_2(x)$ and add to $P_1(x)$.
        $$ (x^3 - 3x^2 - 4x + 12) + (-x^3 + 7x^2 - 16x + 12) $$
        $$ = (1-1)x^3 + (-3+7)x^2 + (-4-16)x + (12+12) $$
        $$ = 0x^3 + 4x^2 - 20x + 24 $$
        $$ = 4x^2 - 20x + 24 $$
    *   Step 4: Simplify the result by dividing by common factor (4).
        $$ \frac{4x^2 - 20x + 24}{4} = x^2 - 5x + 6 $$
    *   **HCF:** $$ x^2 - 5x + 6 $$
*Key Points:*

*   The goal is to eliminate the highest-degree term by making the leading coefficients equal and then changing signs and adding (effectively subtracting).
*   The process can be repeated if the resulting expression is still of a high degree and can be further simplified.
*   The final simplified polynomial obtained through this process is the HCF.



## Topic12:  HCF (Sankalana Vyvakalanaayam) Trick for Algebraic Expressions

This method, "Sankalana Vyvakalanaayam" (addition and subtraction), is used to find the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two algebraic expressions. It involves performing either addition or subtraction of the given expressions to simplify them and identify the common factor. The other method, "Lopana Sthapanapam," is also mentioned as similar.

*How it works:*

1.  **Identify the expressions:** Given two algebraic expressions, let's call them $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$.
2.  **Perform addition or subtraction:**
    *   **Subtraction (Vyvakalana):** Subtract one expression from the other, i.e., $P(x) - Q(x)$.
    *   **Addition (Sankalana):** Add the two expressions, i.e., $P(x) + Q(x)$.
3.  **Simplify the resulting expression:** The goal is to obtain a simpler expression from which a common factor can be easily identified.
4.  **Extract the common factor:** The HCF will be a factor of this simplified expression. Divide the simplified expression by common numerical factors to find the algebraic common factor.
5.  **Verify the HCF (optional but recommended):** The common factor found must be a factor of both original expressions.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

**Example 1: Finding HCF by Subtraction**

*   **Expressions:**
    1.  $x^2 + 5x + 6$
    2.  $x^2 - x - 6$

*   **Step 1: Subtract the second expression from the first.**
    $$ (x^2 + 5x + 6) - (x^2 - x - 6) $$
    Change the signs of the terms in the second expression and add:
    $$ x^2 + 5x + 6 $$
    $$ -x^2 + x + 6 $$
    $$ \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} $$
    $$ 0 + 6x + 12 $$

*   **Step 2: Simplify the resulting expression.**
    The resulting expression is $6x + 12$.

*   **Step 3: Extract the common factor.**
    Divide by the common numerical factor (6):
    $$ \frac{6x + 12}{6} = x + 2 $$

*   **Result:** The HCF is $x + 2$.

    2.  $x^2 - x - 6$

*   **Step 1: Add the two expressions.**
    $$ (x^2 + 5x + 6) + (x^2 - x - 6) $$
    $$ x^2 + 5x + 6 $$
    $$ +x^2 - x - 6 $$
    $$ \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} $$
    $$ 2x^2 + 4x + 0 $$

*   **Step 2: Simplify the resulting expression.**
    The resulting expression is $2x^2 + 4x$.

*   **Step 3: Extract the common factor.**
    Find the common factor of $2x^2$ and $4x$. Both terms have $2x$ as a common factor.
    $$ \frac{2x^2 + 4x}{2x} = x + 2 $$

*   **Result:** The HCF is $x + 2$.
    (Both addition and subtraction yield the same HCF, $x+2$).

**Example 3: Finding HCF by Subtraction**

*   **Expressions:**
    1.  $x^2 + 8x + 7$
    2.  $x^2 - 6x - 7$

*   **Step 1: Subtract the second expression from the first.**
    $$ (x^2 + 8x + 7) - (x^2 - 6x - 7) $$
    Change the signs of the terms in the second expression and add:
    $$ x^2 + 8x + 7 $$
    $$ -x^2 + 6x + 7 $$
    $$ \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} $$
    $$ 0 + 14x + 14 $$

*   **Step 2: Simplify the resulting expression.**
    The resulting expression is $14x + 14$.

*   **Step 3: Extract the common factor.**
    Divide by the common numerical factor (14):

    $$ (x^2 + 8x + 7) + (x^2 - 6x - 7) $$
    $$ x^2 + 8x + 7 $$
    $$ +x^2 - 6x - 7 $$
    $$ \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} $$
    $$ 2x^2 + 2x + 0 $$

*   **Step 2: Simplify the resulting expression.**
    The resulting expression is $2x^2 + 2x$.

*   **Step 3: Extract the common factor.**
    Find the common factor of $2x^2$ and $2x$. Both terms have $2x$ as a common factor.

    (Again, both addition and subtraction yield the same HCF, $x+1$).

*Key Points:*

*   This method is particularly useful for finding the HCF of two algebraic expressions without needing to fully factorize each polynomial individually, especially when dealing with quadratic or higher-degree expressions.
*   By adding or subtracting the expressions, you often simplify them to a form where common factors become apparent.
*   The final step of dividing by the common numerical factor is crucial to get the simplest algebraic HCF.
*   The video states that either addition or subtraction can be used, and in some cases, one might simplify the problem more directly than the other.
*   This method is suitable for problems where traditional factorization might be more complex or time-consuming.

## Topic 13: (SANKALANA VYAVAKALANABHYAM)

This Vedic Math Sutra, "SANKALANA VYAVAKALANABHYAM," translates to "by addition and by subtraction." It offers a quick method to solve a specific type of linear equation with two variables (x and y) when the coefficients are cross-interchanged.

*How it works:*

This trick is particularly useful for systems of linear equations of the form:
$$ Ax \pm By = C_1 $$
$$ Bx \pm Ay = C_2 $$
where the coefficients of x and y are swapped between the two equations. The signs between the terms can be plus or minus.

1.  **Identify the coefficients:** In the given equations, identify the coefficients of x and y.
    *   Equation 1: $A_1x \pm B_1y = C_1$
    *   Equation 2: $A_2x \pm B_2y = C_2$
    *   The trick applies when $A_1 = \pm A_2$ and $B_1 = \pm B_2$ are swapped, meaning the coefficient of 'x' in the first equation is the coefficient of 'y' in the second equation (and vice versa), or they are negative counterparts.

2.  **Step 1: Add the equations:**
    *   Add the two equations together. This will result in an equation where the coefficients of x and y are the sum of their original coefficients.
    *   Let $A_1 = a$, $B_1 = b$, $A_2 = c$, $B_2 = d$.
    *   If the equations are $ax - by = C_1$ and $cx - dy = C_2$, and the coefficients are cross-interchanged (e.g., $a=d$ and $b=c$), then:
        *   $(a+c)x - (b+d)y = C_1 + C_2$.
        *   If the coefficients are identical (e.g., $a=c$ and $b=d$), then $(a+c)x + (b+d)y = C_1 + C_2$.
    *   In the video's examples, the goal is to obtain an equation of the form $(A+B)x - (A+B)y = C_1 + C_2$, or similar, allowing for easy division.

3.  **Step 2: Subtract the equations:**
    *   Subtract the second equation from the first. This will result in an equation where the coefficients of x and y are the difference of their original coefficients.
    *   If the equations are $ax - by = C_1$ and $cx - dy = C_2$, and coefficients are cross-interchanged, then:
        *   $(a-c)x - (b-d)y = C_1 - C_2$.
    *   In the video's examples, the goal is to obtain an equation of the form $(A-B)x + (A-B)y = C_1 - C_2$, or similar, allowing for easy division. Note the sign change in the middle term when subtracting if the original signs are different.

4.  **Solve the resulting simplified equations:**
    *   You will now have two new, simpler linear equations (let's call them Equation A and Equation B).
    *   Equation A will typically be of the form $x - y = \text{constant}$ or $x + y = \text{constant}$.
    *   Equation B will typically be of the form $x + y = \text{constant}$ or $x - y = \text{constant}$.
    *   Solve these two simplified equations simultaneously (e.g., by adding them to eliminate y, or subtracting them to eliminate x) to find the values of x and y.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem:
        1.  $45x - 23y = 113$
        2.  $23x - 25y = 91$ (The instructor notes a correction: it should be $23x - 45y = 91$ to fit the pattern of swapped coefficients. He then proceeds with $23x - 25y = 91$, which is slightly off the intended "Sankalana Vyavakalana" pattern in terms of direct coefficient swap for both terms, but he applies the logic of adding/subtracting for simplified equations).

    *   *Correction applied as per typical pattern:*
        1.  $45x - 23y = 113$
        2.  $23x - 45y = 91$ (This is the ideal pattern for the trick)

    *   *Following the video's actual calculation (with $23x - 25y = 91$):*
        1.  **Addition:** (Adds coefficients of x and y, and the constants)
            *   $(45+23)x - (23+25)y = 113+91$
            *   $68x - 48y = 204$
            *   *(Note: The instructor writes $68x - 68y = 204$ and then $68(x-y) = 68 \times 3$, implying that $y$ coefficient was $23$ for the second equation as well, or there was a typo. Let's assume the coefficients $23$ and $25$ were meant to be $23$ and $23$ for the addition step to yield $68x - 68y$)*
            *   Assuming the intent was $68x - 68y = 204$:
                *   $68(x - y) = 204$
                *   $x - y = \frac{204}{68} = 3$ (Equation A)

        2.  **Subtraction:** (Subtracts coefficients of x and y, and the constants)
            *   $(45-23)x - (23-25)y = 113-91$
            *   $22x - (-2)y = 22$
            *   $22x + 2y = 22$
            *   *(Again, the instructor implies $(45-23)x + (25-23)y = 113-91$ and then $22x+22y=22$, implying that the coefficients for y were $23$ and $25$ but the subtraction was done as $(25-23)$ for the y term resulting in a positive value. This is a common way the trick works for specific coefficient patterns.)*
            *   Assuming the intent was $22x + 22y = 22$:
                *   $22(x + y) = 22$
                *   $x + y = 1$ (Equation B)

        3.  **Solve simplified equations:**
            *   Equation A: $x - y = 3$
            *   Equation B: $x + y = 1$
            *   Add A and B: $(x - y) + (x + y) = 3 + 1 \Rightarrow 2x = 4 \Rightarrow x = 2$
            *   Substitute $x=2$ into Equation B: $2 + y = 1 \Rightarrow y = 1 - 2 \Rightarrow y = -1$
            *   *Result:* $x = 2$, $y = -1$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem:
        1.  $1955x - 476y = 2482$
        2.  $476x + 1955y = -4913$

    *   *Applying the trick:*
        1.  **Addition:** (Adds coefficients of x and y, and the constants)
            *   $(1955+476)x + (-476+1955)y = 2482 + (-4913)$
            *   $2431x + 1479y = -2431$
            *   *(Note: The instructor calculates addition for the x-coefficients as $1955+476 = 2431$, and for the y-coefficients as $-(476+1955) = -2431$, and for the constants $2482 + (-4913) = -2431$. This implies the first equation should have been $1955x - 476y = 2482$ and the second $476x - 1955y = -4913$ to get $2431x - 2431y = -2431$. Let's follow his final derived equation for simplicity.)*
            *   Assuming the derived equation: $2431x - 2431y = -2431$
                *   $2431(x - y) = -2431$
                *   $x - y = -1$ (Equation A)

        2.  **Subtraction:** (Subtracts coefficients of x and y, and the constants)
            *   $(1955-476)x - (476 - (-1955))y = 2482 - (-4913)$
            *   $1479x - (-476 - 1955)y = 2482 + 4913$
            *   $1479x + 2431y = 7395$
            *   *(Note: The instructor implies $1479x + 1479y = 7395$, which suggests that the subtraction of coefficients for y was $1955 - (-476) = 2431$, but he wrote $1479y$. Let's follow his final derived equation for simplicity)*
            *   Assuming the derived equation: $1479x + 1479y = 7395$
                *   $1479(x + y) = 7395$
                *   $x + y = \frac{7395}{1479} = 5$ (Equation B)

        3.  **Solve simplified equations:**
            *   Equation A: $x - y = -1$
            *   Equation B: $x + y = 5$
            *   Add A and B: $(x - y) + (x + y) = -1 + 5 \Rightarrow 2x = 4 \Rightarrow x = 2$
            *   Substitute $x=2$ into Equation B: $2 + y = 5 \Rightarrow y = 5 - 2 \Rightarrow y = 3$
            *   *Result:* $x = 2$, $y = 3$

*Key Points:*

*   This trick is highly effective when the coefficients of the variables are cross-interchanged (e.g., the coefficient of x in the first equation is the coefficient of y in the second equation, and vice versa).
*   By performing a single addition and a single subtraction, the complex equations are simplified into two basic linear equations (like $x \pm y = \text{constant}$), which are then easily solved.
*   Be careful with the signs when adding and subtracting, especially if negative coefficients are involved.
*   This method significantly reduces calculation time compared to standard elimination or substitution methods for such specific patterns.
*   It is particularly useful in competitive exams where speed and accuracy are crucial.

## Topic 14: SOPAANTYADVVAYAMANTYAM - Solving Rational Equations (Vedic Math)

The "Sopaantyadvvayamantyam" sutra from Vedic Mathematics provides a shortcut for solving specific types of rational equations, particularly those where the denominators form an arithmetic progression. This method is especially useful for competitive exams where quick solutions are essential.

### The Problem Format

The method applies to equations of the form:
$$ \frac{1}{AB} + \frac{1}{AC} = \frac{1}{AD} + \frac{1}{BC} $$
where A, B, C, and D are terms, and the terms in the denominators (A, B, C, D) are in an arithmetic progression. This means that if the constants in the terms are consecutive numbers in an arithmetic sequence, this rule can be applied.

### The Rule

If the denominators are structured such that the constants within the terms form an arithmetic progression (e.g., $(x-1), (x-2), (x-3), (x-4)$), the solution for 'x' can be found directly using the following equation:

$$ 2C + D = 0 $$

Where:
*   **A, B, C, D** represent the constants within the terms (e.g., if a term is $(x-k)$, then $k$ is the constant).
*   **C** is the constant of the third term in the arithmetic progression (or the constant of the second term on the left side).
*   **D** is the constant of the fourth term in the arithmetic progression (or the constant of the first term on the right side).

### How to Apply the Rule

1.  **Identify the constants:** Extract the constants from the terms in the denominators, assuming they follow an arithmetic progression. Let these constants be $k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$.
2.  **Map to A, B, C, D:** Assign these constants to A, B, C, and D based on the formula structure.
    *   For $\frac{1}{(x-k_1)(x-k_2)}$, identify $A=k_1$ and $B=k_2$.
    *   For $\frac{1}{(x-k_1)(x-k_3)}$, identify $A=k_1$ and $C=k_3$.
    *   For $\frac{1}{(x-k_1)(x-k_4)}$, identify $A=k_1$ and $D=k_4$.
    *   For $\frac{1}{(x-k_2)(x-k_3)}$, identify $B=k_2$ and $C=k_3$.
3.  **Apply the formula:** Substitute the values of C and D into the equation $2C + D = 0$ to find 'x'.

### Examples from the Video

**Example 1:**
$$ \frac{1}{(x-1)(x-2)} + \frac{1}{(x-1)(x-3)} = \frac{1}{(x-1)(x-4)} + \frac{1}{(x-2)(x-3)} $$

*   **Constants in arithmetic progression:** $1, 2, 3, 4$.
*   **Mapping to formula:**
    *   The terms are of the form $(x-k)$. We extract the constants $k$.
    *   A = 1 (from $x-1$)
    *   B = 2 (from $x-2$)
    *   C = 3 (from $x-3$)
    *   D = 4 (from $x-4$)
*   **Applying the rule $2C + D = 0$:**
    *   Here, C is $x-3$ and D is $x-4$ (as identified in the video's explanation for the formula $2C+D=0$).
    *   $2(x-3) + (x-4) = 0$
    *   $2x - 6 + x - 4 = 0$
    *   $3x - 10 = 0$
    *   $3x = 10$
    *   $x = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33$

**Example 2:**
$$ \frac{1}{x^2 - 4x + 3} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 6x + 5} = \frac{1}{x^2 - 8x + 7} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 8x + 15} $$

*   **Step 1: Factorize the denominators into the $(x-k)$ form.**
    *   For $x^2 - 4x + 3$: We need two numbers that multiply to 3 and add to -4. These are -1 and -3.
        *   So, $x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x-1)(x-3)$.
    *   For $x^2 - 6x + 5$: We need two numbers that multiply to 5 and add to -6. These are -1 and -5.
        *   So, $x^2 - 6x + 5 = (x-1)(x-5)$.
    *   For $x^2 - 8x + 7$: We need two numbers that multiply to 7 and add to -8. These are -1 and -7.
        *   So, $x^2 - 8x + 7 = (x-1)(x-7)$.
    *   For $x^2 - 8x + 15$: We need two numbers that multiply to 15 and add to -8. These are -3 and -5.
        *   So, $x^2 - 8x + 15 = (x-3)(x-5)$.

*   **Step 2: Rewrite the equation with factored denominators:**
    $$ \frac{1}{(x-1)(x-3)} + \frac{1}{(x-1)(x-5)} = \frac{1}{(x-1)(x-7)} + \frac{1}{(x-3)(x-5)} $$

*   **Step 3: Identify the constants and map to the formula:**
    *   Constants in arithmetic progression (from the factors, not the original coefficients): $1, 3, 5, 7$.
    *   A = 1 (from $x-1$)
    *   B = 3 (from $x-3$)
    *   C = 5 (from $x-5$)
    *   D = 7 (from $x-7$)
*   **Applying the rule $2C + D = 0$:**
    *   Here, C is $(x-5)$ and D is $(x-7)$ (as identified by the circles in the video).
    *   $2(x-5) + (x-7) = 0$
    *   $2x - 10 + x - 7 = 0$
    *   $3x - 17 = 0$
    *   $3x = 17$
    *   $x = \frac{17}{3}$

### Key Points:

*   This Vedic math sutra significantly simplifies solving these types of rational equations, especially when the denominators can be factored into linear terms that form an arithmetic progression.
*   The first step is crucial: if the denominators are quadratic expressions, they must be factored into the $(x-k)$ form to identify the constants that form the arithmetic progression.
*   This method bypasses complex algebraic manipulation and finding common denominators, saving considerable time in competitive scenarios.
*   Practicing this method with various examples is important to quickly identify the pattern and apply the rule correctly.


## Topic 15: Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam (Vertical and Crosswise) Vedic Math Trick

Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam is a Vedic Math formula that is applicable to all cases of multiplication and also in the division of a large number by another large number. This method significantly speeds up calculations, allowing for mental computation of large numbers. With practice, even multi-digit multiplications (e.g., 13-digit numbers) can be done in under a minute, surpassing calculator speed.

### How it Works (for 2-digit multiplication):

This method involves three steps, which can be visualized as patterns of multiplication and addition:

**Step 1: Vertical Multiplication of the Units Digits**
*   Multiply the units digits of the two numbers.
*   Write down the units digit of the product and carry over the tens digit (if any).

**Step 2: Crosswise Multiplication and Addition**
*   Multiply the unit digit of the first number by the tens digit of the second number.
*   Multiply the tens digit of the first number by the units digit of the second number.
*   Add these two products together, and then add any carry-over from Step 1.
*   Write down the units digit of this sum and carry over the tens digit (if any).

**Step 3: Vertical Multiplication of the Tens Digits**
*   Multiply the tens digits of the two numbers.
*   Add any carry-over from Step 2.
*   Write down the result.

### Examples from the video (with solutions):

**Example 1: 14 x 12**

    *   Units digits are 4 and 2.
    *   $4 \times 2 = 8$.
    *   Write down 8. (Carry-over: 0)
    *   *Visualization:* Vertical arrow pointing down between 4 and 2.

*   **Step 2 (Crosswise and Add):**
    *   Crosswise multiplications: $(1 \times 2) + (4 \times 1)$
    *   $2 + 4 = 6$.
    *   Add carry-over from Step 1 (0): $6 + 0 = 6$.
    *   Write down 6. (Carry-over: 0)
    *   *Visualization:* Cross arrows between 1 and 2, and 4 and 1.

*   **Step 3 (Vertical, Tens digits):**
    *   Tens digits are 1 and 1.
    *   $1 \times 1 = 1$.
    *   Add carry-over from Step 2 (0): $1 + 0 = 1$.
    *   Write down 1.
    *   *Visualization:* Vertical arrow pointing down between 1 and 1.

*   **Result:** 168

**Example 2: 23 x 35**

*   **Step 1 (Vertical, Units digits):**
    *   Units digits are 3 and 5.
    *   $3 \times 5 = 15$.
    *   Write down 5, carry over 1.
    *   *Visualization:* Mental note: 5 (carry 1)

*   **Step 2 (Crosswise and Add):**
    *   Crosswise multiplications: $(2 \times 5) + (3 \times 3)$
    *   $10 + 9 = 19$.
    *   Add carry-over from Step 1 (1): $19 + 1 = 20$.
    *   Write down 0, carry over 2.
    *   *Visualization:* Mental note: 0 (carry 2), previous 5

*   **Step 3 (Vertical, Tens digits):**
    *   Tens digits are 2 and 3.
    *   $2 \times 3 = 6$.
    *   Add carry-over from Step 2 (2): $6 + 2 = 8$.
    *   Write down 8.
    *   *Visualization:* Mental note: 8, previous 05

*   **Result:** 805

**Example 3: 32 x 47**

*   **Step 1 (Vertical, Units digits):**
    *   Units digits are 2 and 7.
    *   $2 \times 7 = 14$.
    *   Write down 4, carry over 1.

## MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS





##  Topic 16: Difference Identities Subtraction Formulas

This section introduces and explains the subtraction formulas for trigonometric identities, specifically for sine, cosine, and tangent functions when dealing with the difference of two angles, (a - b).
The video is about "DIFFERENCE IDENTITIES SUBTRACTION FORMULAS" in Trigonometry. The speaker explains three main subtraction formulas for sine, cosine, and tangent.

*How it works:*

1.  **Sine (a - b) Formula:**
    When calculating the sine of the difference between two angles (a and b), the formula is:
    $$ \sin(a - b) = \sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b $$
    *   **Explanation:** The formula involves the product of sine of the first angle and cosine of the second, minus the product of cosine of the first angle and sine of the second. The sign within the formula is the same as the difference in the argument (minus).

2.  **Cosine (a - b) Formula:**
    When calculating the cosine of the difference between two angles (a and b), the formula is:
    $$ \cos(a - b) = \cos a \cos b + \sin a \sin b $$
    *   **Explanation:** This formula involves the product of cosines of both angles, plus the product of sines of both angles. Note that for cosine, if the argument is a difference ($a-b$), the formula uses an addition sign (+).

3.  **Tangent (a - b) Formula:**
    When calculating the tangent of the difference between two angles (a and b), the formula is:
    $$ \tan(a - b) = \frac{\tan a - \tan b}{1 + \tan a \tan b} $$
    *   **Explanation:** The numerator is the difference of the tangents of the individual angles, and the denominator is 1 plus the product of the tangents of the individual angles. The sign in the numerator is the same as the difference in the argument (minus), while the sign in the denominator is opposite (plus).

*Examples from the video (with explanations):*

*   **Example for Sine (a - b):**
    *   Problem: Find $\sin(40^\circ)$.
    *   Approach: This can be rewritten as $\sin(70^\circ - 30^\circ)$. Here, $a = 70^\circ$ and $b = 30^\circ$.
    *   Applying the formula:
        $$ \sin(70^\circ - 30^\circ) = \sin 70^\circ \cos 30^\circ - \cos 70^\circ \sin 30^\circ $$
    *   The speaker emphasizes that understanding how to break down an angle (like $40^\circ$) into a difference of two known or calculable angles (like $70^\circ - 30^\circ$) and then applying the formula is key.

*Key Points:*

*   These formulas are fundamental in trigonometry for simplifying expressions and solving problems involving the difference of angles.
*   The speaker advises students to practice these formulas extensively by solving various problems to ensure they are deeply ingrained in their memory.
*   Consistent practice helps in recognizing when and how to apply these identities effectively in different scenarios.
*   The video content focuses on understanding and memorizing these specific subtraction formulas rather than deriving them.

## Topic 18: Height and Distance 
This trick offers a quick method for solving a specific type of "Height and Distance" problem commonly found in trigonometry, particularly relevant for 10th-grade students and competitive exams.

**Problem Type:**

A person observes the top of a hill (or tower, pole, etc.) at an angle of elevation (let's call it $\theta_1$). They then walk a certain distance (let's call it 'D' meters) closer to the hill and observe the top again, this time at a new, larger angle of elevation ($\theta_2$). The goal is to calculate the height of the hill (H) and/or the remaining distance to the hill (X).

**Specific Conditions for this Trick:**

This trick applies specifically when:
*   The first angle of elevation ($\theta_1$) is 30 degrees.
*   The second angle of elevation ($\theta_2$) is 60 degrees.
*   The distance walked closer to the hill (D) is given.

**How the Trick Works (for $\theta_1 = 30^\circ$, $\theta_2 = 60^\circ$):**

1.  **Identify the distance walked (D):** This is the distance the observer moved closer to the hill.
    *   In the example: D = 10 meters.

2.  **Calculate the remaining distance to the hill (X):** This is the distance from the observer's second position to the base of the hill.
    *   **Formula:** X = D / 2
    *   In the example: X = 10 / 2 = 5 meters.

3.  **Calculate the height of the hill (H):**
    *   **Formula:** H = (D / 2) * $\sqrt{3}$
    *   In the example: H = (10 / 2) * $\sqrt{3}$ = 5$\sqrt{3}$ meters.

**Example from the Video:**

*   **Problem:** A man observes the top of a hill at an angle of elevation of 30 degrees. He then walks 10 meters closer to the hill and observes the top again, this time at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees. Calculate the height of the hill?

*   **Given:**
    *   First angle of elevation ($\theta_1$) = 30 degrees
    *   Distance walked (D) = 10 meters
    *   Second angle of elevation ($\theta_2$) = 60 degrees

*   **Solution using the trick:**
    *   Since $\theta_1 = 30^\circ$ and $\theta_2 = 60^\circ$, we can use this specific trick.
    *   **Width of the river (remaining distance, X):** X = D / 2 = 10m / 2 = 5m
    *   **Height of the tower (hill, H):** H = X * $\sqrt{3}$ = 5$\sqrt{3}$ meters

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is a shortcut specifically for scenarios where the angles of elevation are 30° and 60°, and the observer moves *closer* to the object.
*   It simplifies calculations significantly, allowing for a quick solution, especially useful in timed exams.
*   The 'distance walked' (D) is divided by 2 to find the remaining distance to the base (X).
*   The height (H) is found by multiplying the remaining distance (X) by $\sqrt{3}$.
*   Always ensure the problem fits this exact angular configuration (30° and 60°) before applying the trick. For other angle combinations, standard trigonometric methods (using tan, sin, cos) would be required.


Okay, I will extract the data from the video you provided following the same schema as your examples.

## Topic 19: Trigonometry Basics

This section covers the fundamental concepts and formulas of trigonometry, primarily focusing on right-angled triangles.

### Core Trigonometric Ratios

Trigonometry deals with the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, especially right-angled triangles. For any angle $\theta$ in a right-angled triangle, there are six trigonometric ratios, of which three are primary:

1.  **Sine of $\theta$ (sin $\theta$)**
2.  **Cosine of $\theta$ (cos $\theta$)**
3.  **Tangent of $\theta$ (tan $\theta$)**

The other three (cosecant, secant, cotangent) are reciprocals of these.

**Identifying the Sides of a Right-Angled Triangle (Relative to an Angle $\theta$):**

*   **Hypotenuse (H):** The side opposite the 90-degree angle. It is always the longest side.
*   **Opposite (Opp):** The side directly opposite the angle $\theta$.
*   **Adjacent (Adj):** The side next to the angle $\theta$, which is not the hypotenuse.

**Basic Trigonometric Formulas:**

*   **sin $\theta$ = $\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$**
    *   The reciprocal of sin $\theta$ is **cosecant $\theta$ (cosec $\theta$):**
        *   cosec $\theta$ = $\frac{1}{\sin \theta}$ = $\frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Opposite}}$
*   **cos $\theta$ = $\frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$**
    *   The reciprocal of cos $\theta$ is **secant $\theta$ (sec $\theta$):**
        *   sec $\theta$ = $\frac{1}{\cos \theta}$ = $\frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\text{Adjacent}}$
*   **tan $\theta$ = $\frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$**
    *   The reciprocal of tan $\theta$ is **cotangent $\theta$ (cot $\theta$):**
        *   cot $\theta$ = $\frac{1}{\tan \theta}$ = $\frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Opposite}}$

**Key Point:** To solve trigonometry problems, it's crucial to correctly identify the opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse sides relative to the given angle $\theta$.

### Example Problems

**Example 1: Finding sin A and cos A given a relationship between them.**

*   **Problem:** If $3 \sin A = 4 \cos A$, Find the value of sin A and cos A. Also, find tan A.

1.  **Rearrange the given equation:**
    *   $3 \sin A = 4 \cos A$
    *   Divide both sides by $3 \cos A$:
        *   $\frac{3 \sin A}{3 \cos A} = \frac{4 \cos A}{3 \cos A}$
        *   $\frac{\sin A}{\cos A} = \frac{4}{3}$

2.  **Relate to tan A:**
    *   We know that $\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}$.
    *   Therefore, $\tan A = \frac{4}{3}$.

3.  **Construct a right-angled triangle:**
    *   Since $\tan A = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$, we can say that for angle A:
        *   Opposite side = 4
        *   Adjacent side = 3

    *   [Image of a right-angled triangle with angle A, opposite side 4, adjacent side 3]

4.  **Find the Hypotenuse using Pythagoras Theorem:**
    *   Hypotenuse² = Opposite² + Adjacent²
    *   Hypotenuse² = $4^2 + 3^2$
    *   Hypotenuse² = $16 + 9$
    *   Hypotenuse² = $25$
    *   Hypotenuse = $\sqrt{25} = 5$

5.  **Calculate sin A and cos A:**
    *   $\sin A = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{4}{5}$
    *   $\cos A = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{3}{5}$

    *   *Result:*
        *   $\sin A = \frac{4}{5}$
        *   $\cos A = \frac{3}{5}$
        *   $\tan A = \frac{4}{3}$

**Example 2: Finding tan($\beta$) from a given triangle.**

*   **Problem:** Find tan($\beta$) in the triangle.

    *   [Image of a right-angled triangle with vertices A, B, C. Angle C is 90 degrees. Side AC = 3, Side BC = 4, Side AB = 5. Angle B is denoted as $\beta$.]

1.  **Identify the sides relative to angle $\beta$:**
    *   Hypotenuse (opposite 90-degree angle C) = AB = 5
    *   Opposite (opposite angle $\beta$) = AC = 3
    *   Adjacent (next to angle $\beta$, not hypotenuse) = BC = 4

2.  **Apply the tan formula:**
    *   $\tan \beta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$
    *   $\tan \beta = \frac{3}{4}$

    *   *Result:* $\tan \beta = \frac{3}{4}$

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Mastering the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent in terms of opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse is fundamental.
*   The Pythagorean theorem (Hypotenuse² = Opposite² + Adjacent²) is often needed to find a missing side in a right-angled triangle.
*   Always ensure you are identifying the sides correctly relative to the *specific angle* for which the trigonometric ratio is being calculated.
*   Practice these basic concepts as they are essential for more advanced trigonometry and related subjects in mathematics and engineering.


This video explains the sum identities for addition formulas in trigonometry. The formulas discussed are for $\sin(a+b)$, $\cos(a+b)$, and $\tan(a+b)$.



## Topic 20: Sum Identities Addition Formulas

The video presents the following addition formulas:

1.  **$\sin(a+b)$ formula:**
    $$ \sin(a+b) = \sin a \cos b + \cos a \sin b $$
    *   This formula states that the sine of the sum of two angles is the product of the sine of the first angle and the cosine of the second, plus the product of the cosine of the first angle and the sine of the second.

2.  **$\cos(a+b)$ formula:**
    $$ \cos(a+b) = \cos a \cos b - \sin a \sin b $$
    *   This formula states that the cosine of the sum of two angles is the product of the cosines of the two angles, minus the product of the sines of the two angles.

3.  **$\tan(a+b)$ formula:**
    $$ \tan(a+b) = \frac{\tan a + \tan b}{1 - \tan a \tan b} $$
    *   This formula states that the tangent of the sum of two angles is the sum of the tangents of the two angles, divided by one minus the product of their tangents.

**Application Example: Finding $\sin(75^\circ)$**

The instructor demonstrates how to use these formulas to find values like $\sin(75^\circ)$, which is not a standard angle found in basic trigonometric tables.

*   To find $\sin(75^\circ)$, we can express $75^\circ$ as the sum of two standard angles whose values we know: $45^\circ + 30^\circ$.
*   Using the $\sin(a+b)$ formula where $a=45^\circ$ and $b=30^\circ$:
    $$ \sin(75^\circ) = \sin(45^\circ + 30^\circ) $$
    $$ = \sin(45^\circ) \cos(30^\circ) + \cos(45^\circ) \sin(30^\circ) $$

*   Recall the standard trigonometric values:
    *   $\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$
    *   $\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
    *   $\cos(45^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$
    *   $\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$

*   Substitute these values into the formula:
    $$ \sin(75^\circ) = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) $$
    $$ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} $$
    $$ = \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{2\sqrt{2}} $$

**Key Takeaways:**

*   These addition formulas are crucial for breaking down complex angles into simpler ones whose trigonometric values are known.
*   The video also briefly mentions subtraction formulas (e.g., $\sin(a-b)$, $\cos(a-b)$, $\tan(a-b)$), noting that they involve small changes in signs compared to the addition formulas. For example:
    *   $\sin(a-b) = \sin a \cos b - \cos a \sin b$
    *   $\cos(a-b) = \cos a \cos b + \sin a \sin b$
    *   $\tan(a-b) = \frac{\tan a - \tan b}{1 + \tan a \tan b}$
*   The instructor emphasizes the importance of practicing these formulas and their applications regularly to master them.

## Topic 21: Even-Odd Identities 

This video explains and demonstrates the "Even-Odd Identities" in trigonometry, which deal with the behavior of trigonometric functions when the input angle is negative.

*Key Concept:*

The even-odd identities dictate how the sign of a trigonometric function changes (or doesn't change) when the angle $\theta$ is replaced by $-\theta$.

*The Six Even-Odd Identities:*

1.  **Sine:** $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$
2.  **Cosine:** $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$
3.  **Tangent:** $\tan(-\theta) = -\tan(\theta)$
4.  **Cosecant:** $\csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta)$
5.  **Secant:** $\sec(-\theta) = \sec(\theta)$
6.  **Cotangent:** $\cot(-\theta) = -\cot(\theta)$

*Simplified Rule for Remembering:*

*   **Cosine (cos) and Secant (sec) are "even" functions:** When the input angle is negative, the function's value remains positive (or its original sign). The negative sign inside the bracket "disappears".
    *   $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$
    *   $\sec(-\theta) = \sec(\theta)$
*   **Sine (sin), Tangent (tan), Cosecant (csc), and Cotangent (cot) are "odd" functions:** When the input angle is negative, the function's value becomes negative. The negative sign inside the bracket "comes out" in front of the function.
    *   $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$
    *   $\tan(-\theta) = -\tan(\theta)$
    *   $\csc(-\theta) = -\csc(\theta)$
    *   $\cot(-\theta) = -\cot(\theta)$

*Demonstration with an Example Problem:*

The video presents a problem to verify the identity:
$$ \tan(-\theta) \cdot \sin(-\theta) + \cos(-\theta) = \sec(\theta) $$

*Steps to Solve:*

1.  **Apply Even-Odd Identities:** Replace each function with a negative angle using the rules above.
    *   $\tan(-\theta) = -\tan(\theta)$
    *   $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$
    *   $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$

    Substitute these into the equation:
    $$ (-\tan(\theta)) \cdot (-\sin(\theta)) + \cos(\theta) $$

2.  **Simplify the expression:**
    *   Multiply the first two terms: $(-\tan(\theta)) \cdot (-\sin(\theta)) = \tan(\theta) \cdot \sin(\theta)$
    *   The expression becomes: $\tan(\theta) \cdot \sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta)$

3.  **Express in terms of sine and cosine (using Reciprocal Identities):**
    *   We know $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$.
    *   Substitute this into the expression:
        $$ \left(\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}\right) \cdot \sin(\theta) + \cos(\theta) $$

4.  **Perform multiplication:**
    $$ \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} + \cos(\theta) $$

5.  **Combine the terms by finding a common denominator:**
    *   Treat $\cos(\theta)$ as $\frac{\cos(\theta)}{1}$.
    *   The common denominator is $\cos(\theta)$.
    *   Multiply $\frac{\cos(\theta)}{1}$ by $\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$ to get $\frac{\cos^2(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$.
    *   The expression becomes:
        $$ \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} + \frac{\cos^2(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} $$

6.  **Apply Pythagorean Identity:**
    *   We know that $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$.
    *   The expression simplifies to:
        $$ \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} $$

7.  **Apply Reciprocal Identity:**
    *   We know that $\frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} = \sec(\theta)$.
    *   Therefore, the left side of the equation simplifies to $\sec(\theta)$.

*Conclusion:*

The identity $\tan(-\theta) \cdot \sin(-\theta) + \cos(-\theta) = \sec(\theta)$ is verified as true.

*Key Takeaway from the video:*

*   It is crucial to memorize the even-odd identities.
*   The most important thing to remember is that **only cosine and secant remain positive** when opening a bracket with a negative angle (e.g., $\cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)$ and $\sec(-\theta) = \sec(\theta)$).
*   All other trigonometric functions (sine, tangent, cosecant, cotangent) become negative (e.g., $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin(\theta)$).
*   These identities are frequently used in problems requiring proof or simplification of trigonometric expressions.


## Even-Odd Identities in Trigonometry

This video explains and demonstrates the "Even-Odd Identities" in trigonometry, which deal with the behavior of trigonometric functions when the input angle is negative.

### Even-Odd Identities Overview

The main takeaway from these identities is how the sign of the angle ($-\theta$) affects the output of the six trigonometric functions.

*   **Rule:** When the angle inside a trigonometric function is negative, only cosine ($\cos$) and its reciprocal, secant ($\sec$), will result in a positive value. All other trigonometric functions (sine, tangent, cosecant, cotangent) will result in a negative value.

*   **Identities List:**
    *   $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin\theta$
    *   $\cos(-\theta) = \cos\theta$
    *   $\tan(-\theta) = -\tan\theta$
    *   $\csc(-\theta) = -\csc\theta$
    *   $\sec(-\theta) = \sec\theta$
    *   $\cot(-\theta) = -\cot\theta$

*   **Key Insight:** Cosine and Secant are "even" functions, meaning $\cos(-\theta) = \cos\theta$ and $\sec(-\theta) = \sec\theta$. All other four trigonometric functions (sine, tangent, cosecant, cotangent) are "odd" functions, meaning $f(-\theta) = -f(\theta)$.

### Example Problem (Verification of an Identity)

**Problem:** Verify that the following identity is true:
$$ \tan(-\theta) \cdot \sin(-\theta) + \cos(-\theta) = \sec(\theta) $$

**Solution Steps:**

1.  **Apply Even-Odd Identities:** Substitute the known identities into the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation.
    *   We know $\tan(-\theta) = -\tan\theta$
    *   We know $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin\theta$
    *   We know $\cos(-\theta) = \cos\theta$

    So, the LHS becomes:
    $$ (-\tan\theta) \cdot (-\sin\theta) + (\cos\theta) $$

2.  **Simplify the Expression:**
    *   Multiply the first two terms: $(-\tan\theta) \cdot (-\sin\theta) = \tan\theta \cdot \sin\theta$ (since minus times minus is plus).
    *   The expression is now:
        $$ \tan\theta \cdot \sin\theta + \cos\theta $$

3.  **Express in terms of Sine and Cosine:** Recall that $\tan\theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}$ (from reciprocal identities).
    *   Substitute this into the expression:
        $$ \left(\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}\right) \cdot \sin\theta + \cos\theta $$

4.  **Perform Multiplication:**
    *   $$ \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\cos\theta} + \cos\theta $$

5.  **Combine Terms (Find Common Denominator):** Treat $\cos\theta$ as $\frac{\cos\theta}{1}$ and find a common denominator, which is $\cos\theta$.
    *   $$ \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\cos\theta} + \frac{\cos\theta \cdot \cos\theta}{1 \cdot \cos\theta} $$
    *   $$ \frac{\sin^2\theta}{\cos\theta} + \frac{\cos^2\theta}{\cos\theta} $$
    *   Combine the numerators:
        $$ \frac{\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta}{\cos\theta} $$

6.  **Apply Pythagorean Identity:** Recall the Pythagorean identity: $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$.
    *   Substitute this into the numerator:
        $$ \frac{1}{\cos\theta} $$

7.  **Apply Reciprocal Identity:** Recall that $\sec\theta = \frac{1}{\cos\theta}$ (from reciprocal identities).
    *   Therefore:
        $$ \sec\theta $$

8.  **Conclusion:** The left-hand side simplifies to $\sec\theta$, which is equal to the right-hand side (RHS) of the original identity.
    $$ \sec\theta = \sec\theta $$
    The identity is verified as true.

### Key Learning Points:

*   **Memorize Even-Odd Identities:** Understand that $\cos(-\theta) = \cos\theta$ and $\sec(-\theta) = \sec\theta$ (positive), while the other four functions yield negative results (e.g., $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin\theta$).
*   **Interconnectedness of Identities:** Trigonometric problems often require using multiple types of identities (even-odd, reciprocal, Pythagorean) to simplify and prove expressions.
*   **Practice is Crucial:** To master these concepts, it is essential to practice a wide variety of problems involving trigonometric identities.


## Topic 21: Half Angle Formulas

This lesson focuses on Half-Angle Formulas in trigonometry, which are useful for finding trigonometric values of angles that are half of a known angle.

*How it works:*

The main idea is to convert a trigonometric function of a "half angle" (like $\frac{\theta}{2}$) into an expression involving the full angle ($\theta$). This is particularly helpful when the half-angle itself isn't a standard angle (like $0^\circ, 30^\circ, 45^\circ, 60^\circ, 90^\circ$), but the full angle is.

*Formulas:*

The three main Half-Angle Formulas presented are:

1.  **For sine:**
    $$ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}} $$

2.  **For cosine:**
    $$ \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}} $$

3.  **For tangent:**
    $$ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} $$
    (Alternatively, $\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 + \cos\theta}$ or $\tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{1 + \cos\theta}}$ can also be used, though the video primarily focuses on the first one listed).

*Key Points:*

*   The $\pm$ sign in the sine and cosine formulas depends on the quadrant in which the half-angle $\frac{\theta}{2}$ lies.
*   These formulas are used when dealing with angles that have a decimal component (e.g., $112.5^\circ$) or are not standard angles, but their double can be related to a standard angle.
*   The strategy is to **double the given half-angle** to get a standard angle or an angle whose trigonometric value can be easily found using quadrant rules.

*Examples from the video (with solutions):*

*   **Example 1: Find the exact value of $\cos(112.5^\circ)$**
    1.  *Identify the half-angle:* $\frac{\theta}{2} = 112.5^\circ$
    2.  *Double the angle:* $\theta = 2 \times 112.5^\circ = 225^\circ$
    3.  *Apply the cosine half-angle formula:*
        $$ \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}} $$
        $$ \cos(112.5^\circ) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos(225^\circ)}{2}} $$
    4.  *Determine the sign:* $112.5^\circ$ is in the second quadrant, where cosine is negative. So, we choose the negative sign.
    5.  *Find $\cos(225^\circ)$:* $225^\circ$ is in the third quadrant, where cosine is negative.
        $\cos(225^\circ) = \cos(180^\circ + 45^\circ) = -\cos(45^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
    6.  *Substitute and simplify:*
        $$ \cos(112.5^\circ) = -\sqrt{\frac{1 - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}} $$
        $$ \cos(112.5^\circ) = -\sqrt{\frac{\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}} = -\sqrt{\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{4}} $$
        $$ \cos(112.5^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{4}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2} $$

*   **Example 2: Find the exact value of $\sin(105^\circ)$**
    1.  *Identify the half-angle:* $\frac{\theta}{2} = 105^\circ$
    2.  *Double the angle:* $\theta = 2 \times 105^\circ = 210^\circ$
    3.  *Apply the sine half-angle formula:*
        $$ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos\theta}{2}} $$
        $$ \sin(105^\circ) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos(210^\circ)}{2}} $$
    4.  *Determine the sign:* $105^\circ$ is in the second quadrant, where sine is positive. So, we choose the positive sign.
    5.  *Find $\cos(210^\circ)$:* $210^\circ$ is in the third quadrant, where cosine is negative.
        $\cos(210^\circ) = \cos(180^\circ + 30^\circ) = -\cos(30^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
    6.  *Substitute and simplify:*
        $$ \sin(105^\circ) = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \left(-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}} $$
        $$ \sin(105^\circ) = \sqrt{\frac{\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{4}} $$
        $$ \sin(105^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}}{\sqrt{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}}{2} $$
        (Note: The video's written solution in the green box shows a negative sign for $\sqrt{3}$, implying $\cos(210^\circ)$ was taken as positive, which is incorrect for the third quadrant. The verbal explanation correctly states $\cos(30^\circ)$ but does not explicitly show the negative sign being applied in the substitution step for $\cos(210^\circ)$, which would lead to the correct formula of $(2+\sqrt{3})/2$. The example shown in the green box has a $(2-\sqrt{3})/2$, this means the problem for sin was likely $\sin(105^\circ) = \pm\sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos\theta}{2}}$ or the initial formula was applied with error. However, following the correct formula for $\sin(\theta/2)$, the result should be positive.)

*Learning Strategy:*

*   Memorize the three half-angle formulas.
*   For any given half-angle, double it to find $\theta$.
*   Use quadrant rules to determine the correct sign ($\pm$) for $\sin$ and $\cos$.
*   Evaluate the trigonometric function of $\theta$ (if it's a standard angle or can be reduced using quadrant rules).
*   Substitute the value into the formula and simplify.
*   Practice various problems involving different half-angles and trigonometric functions.


## Topic 22:  Polygons

### Polygons Definition

Polygons are 2-dimensional shapes formed with straight lines. Circles are closed 2D figures but not polygons because they are not formed by straight lines.

Examples of polygons include:
*   Triangles
*   Quadrilaterals (rectangles, squares, rhombuses, parallelograms, trapezoids, kites)
*   Pentagons
*   Hexagons

**Key Points for Definition:**
*   **2-dimensional shapes:** Polygons exist in a plane.
*   **Formed with straight lines:** This is a crucial characteristic distinguishing them from curved shapes like circles.
*   **Closed figures:** The lines must connect to enclose an area; open figures are not polygons.
*   **Smallest polygon is a triangle:** Requires a minimum of three straight lines to form a closed figure.
*   **Naming Convention:** Names (e.g., triangle, quadrilateral) indicate the number of sides.

### Names of Polygons based on the Number of Sides

Polygons are named based on the number of sides they have.

| Sides | Polygon Name |
| :---- | :----------- |
| 3     | Triangle     |
| 4     | Quadrilateral or Tetragon |
| 5     | Pentagon     |
| 6     | Hexagon      |
| 7     | Heptagon     |
| 8     | Octagon      |
| 9     | Nonagon      |
| 10    | Decagon      |
| 11    | Hendecagon or Undecagon |
| 12    | Dodecagon    |

For larger polygons, the naming convention typically involves prefixes for tens and units combined with "gon":

| Sides | Polygon Name |
| :---- | :----------- |
| 16    | Hexadecagon  |
| 17    | Heptadecagon |
| 18    | Octadecagon  |
| 19    | Enneadecagon |
| 20    | Icosagon     |
| 30    | Triacontagon |
| 40    | Tetracontagon |
| 50    | Pentacontagon |
| 60    | Hexacontagon |
| 70    | Heptacontagon |
| 80    | Octacontagon |
| 90    | Enneacontagon |
| 100   | Hectogon     |

**Key Points for Naming:**
*   **Prefix-based system:** Polygon names are derived from Greek numerical prefixes.
*   **Memorization is crucial:** Knowing names up to at least 10 sides (Decagon) is generally required for school-level math.
*   **Advanced names for competitive exams:** Names for higher numbers of sides (e.g., Icosagon for 20, Hectogon for 100) are useful for scholarships, Olympiads, and competitive exams like SSC.

### Names of Bigger Polygons (Advanced Knowledge)

For very large numbers of sides, specific names are used:

*   **1000 Sides:** Chillagon
*   **10000 Sides:** Myriagon
*   **100000 Sides:** Decemyriagon
*   **1000000 Sides:** Megagon

**Key Points for Bigger Polygons:**
*   **Specialized terminology:** These names denote polygons with an extremely high number of sides.
*   **Advanced application:** Knowledge of these names is generally for advanced mathematical contexts and specialized competitions, not typical school curricula.

### Polygon Angles

Polygons have two main types of angles: **interior angles** and **exterior angles**.

*   **Interior Angle:** An angle inside the polygon formed by two adjacent sides.
*   **Exterior Angle:** An angle outside the polygon formed by one side and the extension of an adjacent side.

The number of interior angles and exterior angles in a polygon is equal to the number of its sides. For example, a hexagon has 6 sides, 6 interior angles, and 6 exterior angles.

**Key Points for Angles:**
*   **Two Types:** Polygons always have both interior and exterior angles.
*   **Equal Count:** The number of angles (both interior and exterior) matches the number of sides.
*   **Visual Identification:** Interior angles are inside the closed figure, exterior angles are outside (formed by extending a side).

### Polygon Formulas

Here are the key formulas for polygons:

1.  **Sum of Interior Angles:**
    The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with *n* sides is given by:
    $$ 180^\circ \times (n - 2) $$
    *Example:* For a triangle (n=3): $180^\circ \times (3 - 2) = 180^\circ \times 1 = 180^\circ$.

2.  **Sum of Exterior Angles:**
    The sum of the exterior angles of *any* polygon (regardless of the number of sides) is always:
    $$ 360^\circ $$

3.  **Number of Diagonals:**
    A diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices of a polygon. A triangle is the only polygon that does not have any diagonals. The number of diagonals in a polygon with *n* sides is given by:
    $$ \frac{n \times (n - 3)}{2} $$
    *Example:* For a quadrilateral (n=4): $\frac{4 \times (4 - 3)}{2} = \frac{4 \times 1}{2} = 2$.

4.  **Relationship between Interior and Exterior Angles:**
    For any vertex of a polygon, the sum of its interior angle and its adjacent exterior angle is $180^\circ$.
    $$ \text{Polygon Interior Angle} + \text{Exterior Angle} = 180^\circ $$


### Practice Questions

1.  **Calculate the sum of the exterior angle of a polygon with sides 6.**
    *   *Solution:* The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always $360^\circ$. The number of sides (6) does not affect this sum.
    *   *Answer:* $360^\circ$

2.  **Calculate the sum of the interior angle of a polygon with sides 10.**
    *   *Solution:* Using the formula for the sum of interior angles: $180^\circ \times (n - 2)$.
    *   Given $n = 10$.
    *   Sum of interior angles = $180^\circ \times (10 - 2) = 180^\circ \times 8 = 1440^\circ$.
    *   *Answer:* $1440^\circ$

3.  **Find the number of diagonals of a polygon with sides 8.**
    *   *Solution:* Using the formula for the number of diagonals: $\frac{n \times (n - 3)}{2}$.
    *   Given $n = 8$.
    *   Number of diagonals = $\frac{8 \times (8 - 3)}{2} = \frac{8 \times 5}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20$.
    *   *Answer:* 20

4.  **Find the number of sides of a polygon, the sum of whose interior angle is 540.**
    *   *Solution:* Using the formula for the sum of interior angles: $180^\circ \times (n - 2) = \text{Sum of interior angles}$.
    *   Given sum of interior angles = $540^\circ$.
    *   $180^\circ \times (n - 2) = 540^\circ$
    *   $(n - 2) = \frac{540}{180}$
    *   $(n - 2) = 3$
    *   $n = 3 + 2$
    *   $n = 5$
    *   This is a pentagon.
    *   *Answer:* 5 sides (Pentagon)
**Key Points for Formulas:**
*   **Sum of Interior Angles Formula:** $(n-2) \times 180^\circ$, where 'n' is the number of sides. This formula is vital for calculating the total internal angle measure.
*   **Constant Sum of Exterior Angles:** Always $360^\circ$ for any polygon. This is a fundamental property and does not depend on the number of sides.
*   **Number of Diagonals Formula:** $n(n-3)/2$. This helps to quickly determine how many diagonals a polygon has.
*   **Triangle Exception:** A triangle has no diagonals, which can be verified by the formula (3(3-3)/2 = 0).
*   **Linear Pair Relationship:** Interior and exterior angles at the same vertex form a linear pair, summing to $180^\circ$.
*   **Memorization is essential:** These three core formulas (sum of interior angles, sum of exterior angles, number of diagonals) should be well-practiced as they are frequently tested.


Got it! I will now include key points at the end of each section, following the format from your prompt.

## Topic 23:  Factors
Factors are numbers that divide another number evenly, leaving no remainder.
The video explains five different methods to work with factors:
1. Prime Factorization
2. Factors of Exponents
3. Number of Factors
4. Sum of Factors
5. Sum of Reciprocals of Factors
6. Sum of the Product of Factors


### 1. Prime Factorization
Prime factorization is the process of breaking down a number into its prime factors. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have only two factors: 1 and themselves.

**How it works:**
*   You divide the number by the smallest possible prime number (2, 3, 5, etc.) until the result is also a prime number.
*   Then, you write the original number as a product of these prime numbers.

**Examples:**
*   **What are the prime factors of 12?**
    1.  Divide 12 by 2: $12 \div 2 = 6$
    2.  Divide 6 by 2: $6 \div 2 = 3$
    3.  3 is a prime number.
    4.  So, the prime factors of 12 are $2 \times 2 \times 3$.
        *   This can also be written as $2^2 \times 3$.
*   **What is the prime factorization of 81?**
    1.  Divide 81 by 3: $81 \div 3 = 27$
    2.  Divide 27 by 3: $27 \div 3 = 9$
    3.  Divide 9 by 3: $9 \div 3 = 3$
    4.  3 is a prime number.
    5.  So, the prime factors of 81 are $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$.
        *   This can also be written as $3^4$.
*   **What is the prime factorization of 120?**
    1.  Divide 120 by 2: $120 \div 2 = 60$
    2.  Divide 60 by 2: $60 \div 2 = 30$
    3.  Divide 30 by 2: $30 \div 2 = 15$
    4.  Divide 15 by 3: $15 \div 3 = 5$
    5.  5 is a prime number.
    6.  So, the prime factors of 120 are $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$.
        *   This can also be written as $2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1$.

**Key Points:**
*   A prime factor is a prime number that divides a given number exactly.
*   The process involves repeatedly dividing the number by prime numbers until only prime numbers remain.

### 2. Factors of Exponents
When a number is expressed as a product of its prime factors, those prime factors can be written with exponents.
**Example:**
*   For the number 12, its prime factorization is $2 \times 2 \times 3$. This can be written as $2^2 \times 3^1$.
    *   Here, 2 is the base and 2 is the exponent for the first factor.
    *   3 is the base and 1 is the exponent for the second factor.
*   For the number 81, its prime factorization is $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$. This can be written as $3^4$.
    *   Here, 3 is the base and 4 is the exponent.

**Key Points:**
*   Factors of exponents express the prime factorization in a concise way using powers.
*   The base is the prime factor, and the exponent indicates how many times it is multiplied.

### 3. Number of Factors
To find the total number of factors a number has, use the prime factorization method.

**How it works:**
1.  Find the prime factorization of the number.
2.  Write the prime factorization in exponential form (e.g., $p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \ldots$).
3.  Add 1 to each exponent and multiply the results.

**Examples:**
*   **How many factors does 12 have?**
    1.  Prime factorization of 12: $2^2 \times 3^1$.
    2.  Exponents are 2 and 1.
    3.  Add 1 to each exponent: $(2+1) = 3$ and $(1+1) = 2$.
    4.  Multiply the results: $3 \times 2 = 6$.
        *   So, 12 has 6 factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12).
*   **How many factors does 2648 have?**
    1.  Divide 2648 by 2: $2648 \div 2 = 1324$
    2.  Divide 1324 by 2: $1324 \div 2 = 662$
    3.  Divide 662 by 2: $662 \div 2 = 331$
    4.  331 is a prime number.
    5.  Prime factorization of 2648: $2^3 \times 331^1$.
    6.  Exponents are 3 and 1.
    7.  Add 1 to each exponent: $(3+1) = 4$ and $(1+1) = 2$.
    8.  Multiply the results: $4 \times 2 = 8$.
        *   So, 2648 has 8 factors.
*   **How many factors does 144 have?**
    1.  Divide 144 by 2: $144 \div 2 = 72$
    2.  Divide 72 by 2: $72 \div 2 = 36$
    3.  Divide 36 by 2: $36 \div 2 = 18$
    4.  Divide 18 by 2: $18 \div 2 = 9$
    5.  Divide 9 by 3: $9 \div 3 = 3$
    6.  3 is a prime number.
    7.  Prime factorization of 144: $2^4 \times 3^2$.
    8.  Exponents are 4 and 2.
    9.  Add 1 to each exponent: $(4+1) = 5$ and $(2+1) = 3$.
    10. Multiply the results: $5 \times 3 = 15$.
        *   So, 144 has 15 factors.

**Key Points:**
*   This method leverages the prime factorization to efficiently count the total number of factors.
*   Adding 1 to each exponent accounts for all possible combinations of prime factors, including zero occurrences of each prime factor (which corresponds to 1).

### 4. Sum of Factors
To find the sum of all factors of a number, use the prime factorization.

**How it works:**
1.  Find the prime factorization of the number in exponential form (e.g., $p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \ldots$).
2.  For each prime factor $p$ raised to an exponent $e$, calculate $(p^{e+1} - 1) / (p - 1)$.
3.  Multiply the results of these calculations for all prime factors.

**Formula:**
If $N = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{e_k}$, then the sum of factors is:
$$ \left(\frac{p_1^{e_1+1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}\right) \times \left(\frac{p_2^{e_2+1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}\right) \times \ldots \times \left(\frac{p_k^{e_k+1} - 1}{p_k - 1}\right) $$

**Examples:**
*   **Find the sum of factors of 36.**
    1.  Prime factorization of 36: $2^2 \times 3^2$.
    2.  For $2^2$: $(\frac{2^{2+1} - 1}{2 - 1}) = (\frac{2^3 - 1}{1}) = (\frac{8 - 1}{1}) = 7$.
    3.  For $3^2$: $(\frac{3^{2+1} - 1}{3 - 1}) = (\frac{3^3 - 1}{2}) = (\frac{27 - 1}{2}) = (\frac{26}{2}) = 13$.
    4.  Multiply the results: $7 \times 13 = 91$.
        *   So, the sum of factors of 36 is 91.
*   **Find the sum of factors of 144.**
    1.  Prime factorization of 144: $2^4 \times 3^2$.
    2.  For $2^4$: $(\frac{2^{4+1} - 1}{2 - 1}) = (\frac{2^5 - 1}{1}) = (\frac{32 - 1}{1}) = 31$.
    3.  For $3^2$: $(\frac{3^{2+1} - 1}{3 - 1}) = (\frac{3^3 - 1}{2}) = (\frac{27 - 1}{2}) = (\frac{26}{2}) = 13$.
    4.  Multiply the results: $31 \times 13 = 403$.
        *   So, the sum of factors of 144 is 403.

**Key Points:**
*   This method systematically sums all possible products of the prime factors and their powers.
*   The formula ensures that every factor (including 1 and the number itself) is included in the sum.

### 5. Sum of Reciprocals of Factors
To find the sum of the reciprocals of factors of a number.

**How it works:**
1.  Find all the factors of the number.
2.  Calculate the sum of all these factors.
3.  Divide the sum of factors by the original number.

**Formula:**
Sum of reciprocals of factors = (Sum of factors) / (Original number)

**Examples:**
*   **Find the sum of the reciprocal of the factors of 6.**
    1.  Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.
    2.  Sum of factors: $1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12$.
    3.  Divide by the original number (6): $12 \div 6 = 2$.
        *   So, the sum of reciprocals of factors of 6 is 2.
*   **Find the sum of the reciprocals of the factors of 8.**
    1.  Factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8.
    2.  Sum of factors: $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15$.
    3.  Divide by the original number (8): $15 \div 8$.
        *   So, the sum of reciprocals of factors of 8 is $\frac{15}{8}$.

**Key Points:**
*   This method provides a shortcut to sum the reciprocals of factors without individually calculating each reciprocal and then adding them.
*   It directly relates the sum of reciprocals to the sum of the factors and the original number.

### 6. Sum of the Product of Factors
To find the sum of the product of factors of a number.

**How it works:**
1.  Find the prime factorization of the number in exponential form.
2.  Calculate the total number of factors (let's call this 'N').
3.  The product of factors is the original number raised to the power of $\frac{N}{2}$.

**Formula:**
Product of factors = (Original number) $^{(\text{Number of factors})/2}$

**Examples:**
*   **Find the sum of the product of the factors of 36.**
    1.  Prime factorization of 36: $2^2 \times 3^2$.
    2.  Number of factors (N) for 36: $(2+1) \times (2+1) = 3 \times 3 = 9$.
    3.  Product of factors: $36^{9/2}$.
        *   This means $36^{\text{power of}} (4.5)$, which is not an integer.  Let's recheck the number of factors for 36.
            *   Factors of 36 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. There are 9 factors.
        *   So the product of the factors of 36 is $36^{9/2}$.
            *   This is $\sqrt{36^9} = 6^9$.
*   **Find the sum of the product of the factors of 216.**
    1.  Prime factorization of 216: $2^3 \times 3^3$.
    2.  Number of factors (N) for 216: $(3+1) \times (3+1) = 4 \times 4 = 16$.
    3.  Product of factors: $216^{16/2} = 216^8$.
        *   So, the product of the factors of 216 is $216^8$.

**Key Points:**
*   This method efficiently calculates the product of all factors without having to list them all out and multiply them individually.
*   It relies on the total number of factors (N) to determine the exponent of the original number.

*   1 yard (yd) = 0.9144 m
*   1.6 m = 5.24 ft
*   1.8 m = 5.9 ft
*   1 nautical mile = 6080 ft
*   1 light year = $9.461 \times 10^{15}$ m

**Example Conversions from the Video:**

*   5000 m = 5 km

## Differentiation Trick 1

This trick provides a shortcut for differentiating an infinite series of nested square roots of a function:
$$ y = \sqrt{f(x) + \sqrt{f(x) + \sqrt{f(x) + \ldots}}} $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the inner function:** Determine the function $f(x)$ that is repeatedly appearing inside the square roots.
    *   Example 1: $y = \sqrt{\sin x + \sqrt{\sin x + \sqrt{\sin x + \ldots}}}$ (Here, $f(x) = \sin x$)
    *   Example 2: $y = \sqrt{\tan x + \sqrt{\tan x + \sqrt{\tan x + \ldots}}}$ (Here, $f(x) = \tan x$)
    *   Example 3: $y = \sqrt{\cos x + \sqrt{\cos x + \sqrt{\cos x + \ldots}}}$ (Here, $f(x) = \cos x$)

2.  **Find the derivative of the inner function:** Calculate $f'(x)$, the derivative of $f(x)$.
    *   Example 1: $f'(x) = \cos x$
    *   Example 2: $f'(x) = \sec^2 x$
    *   Example 3: $f'(x) = -\sin x$

3.  **Apply the formula:** Use the given formula to directly find the derivative $dy/dx$.

**General Formula:**

$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{f'(x)}{2y - 1} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = \sqrt{\sin x + \sqrt{\sin x + \sqrt{\sin x + \ldots}}} $$
    *   Inner function $f(x)$: $\sin x$
    *   Derivative of inner function $f'(x)$: $\cos x$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\cos x}{2y - 1} $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = \sqrt{\tan x + \sqrt{\tan x + \sqrt{\tan x + \ldots}}} $$
    *   Inner function $f(x)$: $\tan x$
    *   Derivative of inner function $f'(x)$: $\sec^2 x$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\sec^2 x}{2y - 1} $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = \sqrt{\cos x + \sqrt{\cos x + \sqrt{\cos x + \ldots}}} $$
    *   Inner function $f(x)$: $\cos x$
    *   Derivative of inner function $f'(x)$: $-\sin x$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-\sin x}{2y - 1} $$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is specifically for infinitely nested square roots with addition (or subtraction, though the video examples show addition).
*   The denominator $2y - 1$ is constant in the formula, making it a very quick shortcut.
*   Memorizing the derivatives of common trigonometric functions is crucial for speed.



## DIFFERENTIATION : TRICK 2

**Problem Type:** Differentiation of functions of the form $[f(x)]^{g(x)}$, where both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are functions of $x$.

**Trick Formula:**
For $y = (f(x))^{g(x)}$, the derivative $y'$ is:
$$ y' = (f(x))^{g(x)} \left[ \frac{g(x)}{f(x)} \cdot f'(x) + g'(x) \cdot \log(f(x)) \right] $$
where $f'(x)$ is the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$, and $g'(x)$ is the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$.

**How it works (from video explanation):**

1.  **Identify $f(x)$ and $g(x)$:** Identify the base function $f(x)$ and the exponent function $g(x)$.
2.  **Calculate $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$:** Find the derivatives of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ with respect to $x$.
3.  **Substitute into the formula:** Plug the values of $f(x)$, $g(x)$, $f'(x)$, and $g'(x)$ into the given formula.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: Find the derivative of $\frac{d}{dx}(a^a)$
    *   Identification: $f(x) = a$, $g(x) = a$. Assuming 'a' is the variable of differentiation, then $f'(x) = 1$ and $g'(x) = 1$.
    *   **Result:** $$ (a^a) \left[ \frac{a}{a} \cdot (1) + (1) \cdot \log a \right] = (a^a) [1 + \log a] $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: Find the derivative of $\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x)^{\tan x}$
    *   Identification: $f(x) = \sin x$, $f'(x) = \cos x$, $g(x) = \tan x$, $g'(x) = \sec^2 x$
    *   **Result:** $$ (\sin x)^{\tan x} \left[ \frac{\tan x}{\sin x} \cdot \cos x + \sec^2 x \cdot \log(\sin x) \right] $$
    $$ = (\sin x)^{\tan x} \left[ 1 + \sec^2 x \cdot \log(\sin x) \right] $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: Find the derivative of $\frac{d}{dx}(\sin x)^{\cos x}$
    *   Identification: $f(x) = \sin x$, $f'(x) = \cos x$, $g(x) = \cos x$, $g'(x) = -\sin x$
    *   **Result:** $$ (\sin x)^{\cos x} \left[ \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} \cdot \cos x + (-\sin x) \cdot \log(\sin x) \right] $$
    $$ = (\sin x)^{\cos x} \left[ \cot x \cdot \cos x - \sin x \cdot \log(\sin x) \right] $$
## Differentiation Trick 3

This trick provides a shortcut for differentiating functions where a base function is raised to itself in an infinite power series:
$$ y = f(x)^{f(x)^{f(x)^{\ldots}}} $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the base function:** Determine the function $f(x)$ that is being repeatedly raised as a power.
    *   Example 1: $dy = \sin x^{\sin x^{\sin x \ldots}}$ (Here, $f(x) = \sin x$)
    *   Example 2: $dy = \tan x^{\tan x^{\tan x \ldots}}$ (Here, $f(x) = \tan x$)
    *   Example 3: $dy = \cos x^{\cos x^{\cos x \ldots}}$ (Here, $f(x) = \cos x$)

2.  **Find the derivative of the base function:** Calculate $f'(x)$, the derivative of $f(x)$.
    *   Example 1: $f'(x) = \cos x$
    *   Example 2: $f'(x) = \sec^2 x$
    *   Example 3: $f'(x) = -\sin x$

3.  **Apply the formula:** Use the given formula to directly find the derivative $dy/dx$.

**General Formula:**

$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y^2}{1 - \log y} \times \frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ dy = \sin x^{\sin x^{\sin x \ldots}} $$
    *   Base function $f(x)$: $\sin x$
    *   Derivative of base function $f'(x)$: $\cos x$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y^2}{1 - \log y} \times \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ dy = \tan x^{\tan x^{\tan x \ldots}} $$
    *   Base function $f(x)$: $\tan x$
    *   Derivative of base function $f'(x)$: $\sec^2 x$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y^2}{1 - \log y} \times \frac{\sec^2 x}{\tan x} $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ dy = \cos x^{\cos x^{\cos x \ldots}} $$
    *   Base function $f(x)$: $\cos x$
    *   Derivative of base function $f'(x)$: $-\sin x$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y^2}{1 - \log y} \times \frac{-\sin x}{\cos x} $$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is for functions where the exponentiation is self-referential and infinite.
*   The common term $y^2/(1 - \log y)$ is always part of the solution.
*   Knowledge of basic derivatives of trigonometric functions is necessary.

## Differentiation Trick 4

This trick provides a shortcut for differentiating functions of the form:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} (x^n) $$
and also:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} (c \cdot x^n) $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the exponent and coefficient:** In the given expression, identify the exponent 'n' of 'x'. If there's a constant coefficient 'c' multiplying $x^n$, identify that too.
    *   Example 1: $x^5$ (here, $n=5$, implicit $c=1$)
    *   Example 2: $x^{10}$ (here, $n=10$, implicit $c=1$)
    *   Example 3: $5x^2$ (here, $n=2$, $c=5$)

2.  **Multiply by the exponent:** Multiply the coefficient (or 1 if no explicit coefficient) by the exponent 'n'. This becomes the new coefficient.

3.  **Reduce the exponent:** Subtract 1 from the original exponent 'n'. This becomes the new exponent of 'x'.

**General Formula:**

$$ \frac{d}{dx} (x^n) = nx^{n-1} $$
$$ \frac{d}{dx} (cx^n) = c \cdot n \cdot x^{n-1} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} (x^5) $$
    *   Exponent (n): 5
    *   **Result:** $$ 5x^{5-1} = 5x^4 $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} (x^{10}) $$
    *   Exponent (n): 10
    *   **Result:** $$ 10x^{10-1} = 10x^9 $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} (5x^2) $$
    *   Coefficient (c): 5
    *   Exponent (n): 2
    *   **Result:** $$ 5 \cdot 2 \cdot x^{2-1} = 10x^1 = 10x $$

**Key Points:**

*   This is the fundamental power rule of differentiation.
*   It's widely used and essential for differentiating polynomial terms.


## Differentiation Trick 5

This trick provides a shortcut for differentiating logarithmic functions of the form:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} (\log x^n) $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the exponent:** In the given expression, identify the exponent 'n' of 'x' inside the logarithm.
    *   Example 1: $\log x$ (here, $n=1$)
    *   Example 2: $\log x^2$ (here, $n=2$)
    *   Example 3: $\log x^4$ (here, $n=4$)
    *   Example 4: $\log 5x^3$ (here, $n=3$, and there's a coefficient $c=5$)

2.  **Form the numerator:** The exponent 'n' becomes the numerator of the result.

3.  **Form the denominator:** The 'x' term (or 'cx' term if there's a coefficient) becomes the denominator.

4.  **Special Case with Coefficient:** If the term inside the logarithm is $cx^n$, the derivative is $n/(cx)$.

**General Formula:**

$$ \frac{d}{dx} (\log x^n) = \frac{n}{x} $$
$$ \frac{d}{dx} (\log (cx^n)) = \frac{n}{cx} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} \log x $$
    *   Exponent (n): 1
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{x} $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} \log x^2 $$
    *   Exponent (n): 2
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{2}{x} $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} \log x^4 $$
    *   Exponent (n): 4
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{4}{x} $$

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} \log 5x^3 $$
    *   Exponent (n): 3
    *   Coefficient (c): 5
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{3}{5x} $$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick simplifies the differentiation of logarithmic terms where the argument is a power of x.
*   Remember to handle any constant coefficients inside the logarithm correctly by placing them in the denominator.

## Differentiation Trick 6

This trick provides a shortcut for differentiating an infinite series of the form:
$$ y = \left[ x + \frac{x^p}{p} + \frac{x^{p+d}}{p+d} + \frac{x^{p+2d}}{p+2d} + \ldots \infty \right] $$
where 'd' is the common difference between the exponents and their respective denominators.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the pattern:** Observe if the series has terms where the exponent of 'x' in the numerator is the same as the denominator, and these pairs (exponent/denominator) increase by a constant common difference 'd'.
    *   Example 1: $x^3/3, x^5/5, x^7/7$. Here, powers/denominators are 3, 5, 7, so common difference $d=2$.
    *   Example 2: $x^2/2, x^4/4, x^6/6$. Here, powers/denominators are 2, 4, 6, so common difference $d=2$.

2.  **Determine the common difference 'd':** Calculate the difference between consecutive exponents (or denominators) in the series.

3.  **Apply the formula:** The derivative $dy/dx$ will be $1/(1 - x^d)$.

**General Formula:**

For a series following the described pattern with common difference 'd':
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{1 - x^d} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = \left[ x + \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} + \frac{x^7}{7} + \ldots \infty \right] $$
    *   Common difference (d): $5 - 3 = 2$ (or $7 - 5 = 2$)
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{1 - x^2} $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = \left[ x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{4} + \frac{x^6}{6} + \ldots \infty \right] $$
    *   Common difference (d): $4 - 2 = 2$ (or $6 - 4 = 2$)
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{1 - x^2} $$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is highly specific to the given series pattern.
*   The common difference 'd' is essential for applying the shortcut.
*   The initial 'x' term in the series doesn't affect the 'd' value, but is part of the pattern.

## Differentiation Trick 7

This trick provides a shortcut for differentiating functions of the form:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{x^n} $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the exponent:** In the given expression, identify the exponent 'n' of 'x' in the denominator.
    *   Example 1: $1/x^2$ (here, $n=2$)
    *   Example 2: $1/x^3$ (here, $n=3$)
    *   Example 3: $1/x^5$ (here, $n=5$)
    *   Example 4: $1/x^{1000}$ (here, $n=1000$)

2.  **Form the numerator:** The exponent 'n' is taken, its sign is changed to negative, and it becomes the numerator. So, it's $-n$.

3.  **Form the denominator:** Add 1 to the original exponent 'n', and this becomes the new power of 'x' in the denominator. So, it's $x^{(n+1)}$.

**General Formula:**

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{x^n} = \frac{-n}{x^{n+1}} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{x^2} $$
    *   Exponent (n): 2
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{-2}{x^3} $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{x^3} $$
    *   Exponent (n): 3
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{-3}{x^4} $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{x^5} $$
    *   Exponent (n): 5
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{-5}{x^6} $$

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: $$ \frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{x^{1000}} $$
    *   Exponent (n): 1000
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{-1000}{x^{1001}} $$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick provides a quick way to differentiate expressions with $x^n$ in the denominator.
*   The negative sign in the numerator and the incremented power in the denominator are crucial.

## Differentiation Trick 8

This trick provides a shortcut for differentiating algebraic expressions consisting of a sum of power terms and a constant:
$$ y = x^a + x^b + C $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify terms:** Separate the expression into individual terms. These will typically be powers of 'x' (e.g., $x^n$) and/or constant terms.
    *   Example 1: $y = x^6 + x^3 + 7$
        *   Terms: $x^6$, $x^3$, $7$
    *   Example 2: $y = x^7 + x^5 + 8$
        *   Terms: $x^7$, $x^5$, $8$

2.  **Differentiate each power term:** For each term of the form $x^n$, apply the power rule of differentiation: $n \cdot x^{(n-1)}$.
    *   Example 1: $x^6 \rightarrow 6x^5$; $x^3 \rightarrow 3x^2$
    *   Example 2: $x^7 \rightarrow 7x^6$; $x^5 \rightarrow 5x^4$

3.  **Differentiate constant terms:** The derivative of any constant term (e.g., $7$ or $8$) is 0.

4.  **Sum the derivatives:** Add the derivatives of all individual terms to get the final result.

**General Formula:**

For $y = \sum_i x^{n_i} + C$, the derivative $dy/dx = \sum_i n_i x^{n_i-1}$.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = x^6 + x^3 + 7 $$
    *   Derivative of $x^6$: $6x^{6-1} = 6x^5$
    *   Derivative of $x^3$: $3x^{3-1} = 3x^2$
    *   Derivative of $7$: $0$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = 6x^5 + 3x^2 $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = x^7 + x^5 + 8 $$
    *   Derivative of $x^7$: $7x^{7-1} = 7x^6$
    *   Derivative of $x^5$: $5x^{5-1} = 5x^4$
    *   Derivative of $8$: $0$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = 7x^6 + 5x^4 $$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick emphasizes differentiating each term independently and ignoring constants.
*   It's a straightforward application of the sum rule and power rule of differentiation.

My apologies for not adhering precisely to your previous instructions. I will now present the extracted information exactly as you provided the template, including the formatting and structure.

## DIFFERENTIATION : TRICK 9

**Problem Type:** Differentiation of rational functions where the numerator and denominator are polynomials with a specific pattern of powers.
Specifically, differentiating functions of the form:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{1 + x^n + x^{2n}}{1 + x + x^2} \right] $$
*(Note: The formula in the video displays a specific example structure: $\frac{1 + x^2 + x^4}{1 + x + x^2}$. The instructor then shows another example $\frac{1 + x^4 + x^8}{1 + x^2 + x^4}$. This indicates that the trick applies when the powers in the numerator are double the corresponding powers in the denominator, and the first term is 1 in both.)*

**Trick Formula:**
For a function like $y = \frac{1 + x^{2m} + x^{4m}}{1 + x^m + x^{2m}}$ (where $m$ can be 1 or any other integer power), the derivative is:
$$ y' = \text{(Constant) } \times \text{ (Derivative of the power of x from the denominator's middle term)} - 1 $$
*(Based on the video's examples, the simplified answer seems to be related to the derivative of the terms in the denominator, rather than a direct derivative of the full fraction.)*
Let's analyze the pattern from the examples to derive the rule.

**How it works (from video explanation):**

1.  **Identify the pattern:** The trick applies when the numerator's terms are $1$, $x^{2m}$, $x^{4m}$ and the denominator's terms are $1$, $x^m$, $x^{2m}$. (e.g., $m=1$ gives $1+x^2+x^4$ and $1+x+x^2$; $m=2$ gives $1+x^4+x^8$ and $1+x^2+x^4$).
2.  **Focus on the middle term of the denominator:** Take the exponent of $x$ from the middle term of the denominator (e.g., $x^m \implies m$).
3.  **Multiply by $x$ and subtract 1:** The derivative is $m \times x - 1$. This essentially means $2x-1$ if $m=1$, or $4x^3-1$ if $m=2$ etc. (Wait, the instructor just writes '2x' then '-1'. This needs clarification.)

Let's carefully re-examine the video's actual calculation steps, as the formula provided might be a general simplification. The instructor states "ഡബിൾ വന്നാൽ $2x$ എന്ന് എഴുതുക" which means "if double comes, write $2x$".

**Video's simplified derivation steps (not a direct formula application, but a rapid simplification process):**

For expressions like $\frac{1+x^{2a}+x^{4a}}{1+x^a+x^{2a}}$, this expression simplifies to $1-x^a+x^{2a}$ if $a$ is the lowest power, and then the derivative is taken. The trick seems to be about simplifying the fraction *before* differentiating.

The algebraic identity is: $1 + x^2 + x^4 = (1 - x + x^2)(1 + x + x^2)$.
So, $\frac{1 + x^2 + x^4}{1 + x + x^2} = 1 - x + x^2$.
Then, the derivative of $1 - x + x^2$ is $-1 + 2x$.

**How the video calculates the answer directly:**
1.  Identify the middle term's power in the denominator.
2.  Multiply this power by $x$ and subtract 1. (This is *very* specific.)

**Example 1 (from video):**

*   **Problem:** Find the derivative of $y = \frac{1 + x^2 + x^4}{1 + x + x^2}$
*   **Steps (video's rapid method):**
    1.  The pattern is $1$, $x^1$, $x^2$ in the denominator, and $1$, $x^2$, $x^4$ in the numerator.
    2.  The denominator's middle term is $x$. Its exponent is 1.
    3.  Multiply this by $x$ and subtract 1: $1 \times x - 1 = x - 1$.
    *(Note: The video writes '2x' and then '-1'. This implies for the first example, the answer should be $2x - 1$. Let's reconcile with the simplification $1-x+x^2$. The derivative of $1-x+x^2$ is $-1+2x$. This matches the video's stated $2x-1$. So the trick is first to simplify the fraction to $1-x^m+x^{2m}$ and then differentiate. The "2x" comes from differentiating $x^2$.)*
    The trick is: when you have $\frac{1 + x^{2m} + x^{4m}}{1 + x^m + x^{2m}}$, it simplifies to $1 - x^m + x^{2m}$.
    Then, its derivative is $-m x^{m-1} + 2m x^{2m-1}$.

Let's re-evaluate the direct calculation from the video in this context.
For $y = \frac{1 + x^2 + x^4}{1 + x + x^2}$:
This simplifies to $1 - x + x^2$.
Derivative is $-1 + 2x$. This is $2x-1$. This matches the video's final answer.

**Example 2 (from video):**

*   **Problem:** Find the derivative of $y = \frac{1 + x^4 + x^8}{1 + x^2 + x^4}$
*   **Steps (video's rapid method):**
    1.  The pattern is $1$, $x^2$, $x^4$ in the denominator, and $1$, $x^4$, $x^8$ in the numerator. Here $m=2$.
    2.  This simplifies to $1 - x^2 + (x^2)^2 = 1 - x^2 + x^4$.
    3.  Derivative of $1 - x^2 + x^4$ is $-2x + 4x^3$.
    *(The video states '2x-1'. This is wrong based on the pattern derived from the first example. The simplified fraction for this example is $1-x^2+x^4$. Its derivative is $-2x+4x^3$. The video stating $2x-1$ suggests a fundamental misunderstanding or misstatement of the trick by the instructor in this particular example.)*

Based on the common algebraic identity $\frac{1+a^2+a^4}{1+a+a^2} = 1-a+a^2$.
So if $a = x^m$, then $\frac{1+(x^m)^2+(x^m)^4}{1+x^m+(x^m)^2} = 1-x^m+(x^m)^2 = 1-x^m+x^{2m}$.
The derivative of this is $-m x^{m-1} + 2m x^{2m-1}$.

For Example 1: $m=1$. Derivative is $-1 x^{1-1} + 2(1) x^{2(1)-1} = -1 + 2x^1 = 2x - 1$. (Matches video)
For Example 2: $m=2$. Derivative is $-2 x^{2-1} + 2(2) x^{2(2)-1} = -2x + 4x^3$. (Does *not* match video's stated $2x-1$ answer, which is incorrect for this example).

**Conclusion for Trick 9:** The trick is based on simplifying the fraction using the identity $1+A^2+A^4 / 1+A+A^2 = 1-A+A^2$. Once simplified, differentiate. The video's quick "2x-1" for all cases with just different powers $x^2, x^4$ is incorrect. It should be applied after finding $1-x^m+x^{2m}$ and differentiating.

**Problem Type:** Differentiation of functions in an infinite series where a base 'a' is raised to a function $f(x)$, and this pattern repeats infinitely.
Specifically, differentiating functions of the form:
$$ y = a^{f(x)} + a^{f(x)} + a^{f(x)} + \dots \infty $$

**Trick Formula:**
For $y = a^{f(x)} + a^{f(x)} + a^{f(x)} + \dots \infty$, the derivative $y'$ is:
$$ y' = \frac{\log a \cdot y \cdot f'(x)}{1 - y \log a} $$

**How it works (from video explanation):**

1.  **Identify 'a' and $f(x)$:** Identify the constant base 'a' and the function in the exponent $f(x)$.
2.  **Calculate $f'(x)$:** Find the derivative of $f(x)$.
3.  **Substitute into the formula:** Plug the values of $a$, $y$, and $f'(x)$ into the given formula.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = 10^x + 10^x + 10^x + \dots \infty $$
    *   Identification: $a = 10$, $f(x) = x$, $f'(x) = 1$
    *   **Result:** $$ y' = \frac{\log 10 \cdot y \cdot 1}{1 - y \log 10} $$

*   **Example 2:**

**Problem Type:** Differentiation of functions where a function of $x$ is raised to the power of the same function of $x$.
Specifically, differentiating functions of the form:
$$ y = (f(x))^{f(x)} $$

**Trick Formula:**
For $y = (f(x))^{f(x)}$, the derivative $y'$ is:
$$ y' = (f(x))^{f(x)} \left[ 1 + \log(f(x)) \right] f'(x) $$

**How it works (from video explanation):**

1.  **Identify the base function:** For the given function $y = (f(x))^{f(x)}$, identify the base function $f(x)$.
2.  **Write the original function:** The first part of the derivative is the original function itself: $(f(x))^{f(x)}$.
3.  **Add `1 + log(f(x))`:** Inside square brackets, write $1 + \log(f(x))$.
4.  **Multiply by the derivative of the base function:** Multiply the entire expression by $f'(x)$, which is the derivative of the base function $f(x)$.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = (\tan x)^{\tan x} $$
    *   Identification: $f(x) = \tan x$, $f'(x) = \sec^2 x$
    *   **Result:** $$ y' = (\tan x)^{\tan x} [1 + \log(\tan x)] \sec^2 x $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = (\sin x)^{\sin x} $$
    *   Identification: $f(x) = \sin x$, $f'(x) = \cos x$
    *   **Result:** $$ y' = (\sin x)^{\sin x} [1 + \log(\sin x)] \cos x $$

    *   Problem: $$ y = (x^2)^{x^2} $$
    *   Identification: $f(x) = x^2$, $f'(x) = 2x$
    *   **Result:** $$ y' = (x^2)^{x^2} [1 + \log(x^2)] 2x $$

*   **Example 4:**
    *   Problem: $$ y = (\cos x)^{\cos x} $$
    *   Identification: $f(x) = \cos x$, $f'(x) = -\sin x$

**Problem Type:** Differentiation of rational functions where the numerator and denominator contain the same base function, $p(x)$, in a linear form.
Specifically, differentiating functions of the form:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{ap(x) + b}{cp(x) + d} \right) $$

**Trick Formula:**
$$ \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{ap(x) + b}{cp(x) + d} \right) = \frac{ad - bc}{(\text{denominator})^2} \times p'(x) $$

**How it works (from video explanation):**

1.  **Identify coefficients:** For the given function $\frac{ap(x) + b}{cp(x) + d}$, identify the coefficients $a, b, c, d$.
2.  **Calculate determinant-like term for numerator:** Multiply $a$ by $d$ and $c$ by $b$. Find the difference: $ad - bc$. This forms the numerator of the derivative.
3.  **Square the denominator:** The denominator of the derivative will be the square of the original denominator: $(cp(x) + d)^2$.
4.  **Multiply by the derivative of the base function:** Multiply the entire fraction by $p'(x)$, which is the derivative of the base function $p(x)$ (the function that appears as $p(x)$ in the numerator and denominator).

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: Find the derivative of $y = \frac{3\sin x + 5}{5\sin x + 3}$
    *   Identification: $p(x) = \sin x$, $a = 3$, $b = 5$, $c = 5$, $d = 3$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{3\sin x + 5}{5\sin x + 3} \right) = \frac{(3 \times 3) - (5 \times 5)}{(5\sin x + 3)^2} \times \cos x = \frac{9 - 25}{(5\sin x + 3)^2} \times \cos x = \frac{-16}{(5\sin x + 3)^2} \times \cos x $$
    *(Note: The video's written answer for the numerator constant is '16' without a negative sign, implying $|ad-bc|$ or an implicit sign adjustment. However, following the formula $ad-bc$ explicitly gives $-16$. If $p'(x)$ can introduce a negative sign that cancels with this, the overall outcome would be positive, as seen in the next example.)*

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: Find the derivative of $y = \frac{4\cos x + 7}{5\cos x + 4}$
    *   Identification: $p(x) = \cos x$, $a = 4$, $b = 7$, $c = 5$, $d = 4$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{4\cos x + 7}{5\cos x + 4} \right) = \frac{(4 \times 4) - (5 \times 7)}{(5\cos x + 4)^2} \times (-\sin x) = \frac{16 - 35}{(5\cos x + 4)^2} \times (-\sin x) = \frac{-19}{(5\cos x + 4)^2} \times (-\sin x) = \frac{19\sin x}{(5\cos x + 4)^2} $$

**Problem Type:** Differentiation of implicit functions that can be rearranged into the form $F(x, y) = 0$.
Specifically, questions where the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is required for equations like $y = x^3 + y^3 = 2axy$.

**Trick Formula:**
For an implicit function $F(x, y) = C$ (constant), where $F(x, y)$ can be rewritten as $f(x, y) = 0$, the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is given by:
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{\text{Partial derivative of } F(x, y) \text{ with respect to } x}{\text{Partial derivative of } F(x, y) \text{ with respect to } y} = - \frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}} $$

**How it works (from video explanation):**

1.  **Rearrange the equation:** Move all terms to one side to make the equation equal to zero. For example, $x^3 + y^3 = 2axy$ becomes $x^3 + y^3 - 2axy = 0$. Let this be $F(x, y)$.
2.  **Calculate the numerator ($\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$):**
    *   Find the derivative of $F(x, y)$ with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as a constant.
3.  **Calculate the denominator ($\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$):**
    *   Find the derivative of $F(x, y)$ with respect to $y$, treating $x$ as a constant.
4.  **Form the fraction with a negative sign:** The derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ will be $- \frac{\text{Numerator}}{\text{Denominator}}$.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: Find the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ for $y = x^3 + y^3 = 2axy$
    *   Steps:
        1.  Rearrange: $F(x, y) = x^3 + y^3 - 2axy = 0$
        2.  $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$: Derivative of $x^3$ is $3x^2$. Derivative of $y^3$ (y is constant) is $0$. Derivative of $-2axy$ (treating $y$ as constant) is $-2ay$. So, Numerator $= 3x^2 - 2ay$.
        3.  $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$: Derivative of $x^3$ (x is constant) is $0$. Derivative of $y^3$ is $3y^2$. Derivative of $-2axy$ (treating $x$ as constant) is $-2ax$. So, Denominator $= 3y^2 - 2ax$.
    *   **Result:**
        $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{3x^2 - 2ay}{3y^2 - 2ax} $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: Find the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ for $y = x^4 + y^3 - 3axy$
    *   Steps:
        1.  Rearrange: $F(x, y) = x^4 + y^3 - 3axy = 0$
        2.  $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$: Derivative of $x^4$ is $4x^3$. Derivative of $y^3$ (y is constant) is $0$. Derivative of $-3axy$ (treating $y$ as constant) is $-3ay$. So, Numerator $= 4x^3 - 3ay$.
        3.  $\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}$: Derivative of $x^4$ (x is constant) is $0$. Derivative of $y^3$ is $3y^2$. Derivative of $-3axy$ (treating $x$ as constant) is $-3ax$. So, Denominator $= 3y^2 - 3ax$.

**Problem Type:** Application of differentiation to physics problems, specifically finding the minimum/maximum value of a quantity (like charge) with respect to time, or force from momentum.

**Key Concepts from Physics/Calculus:**

*   **Minimum/Maximum:** To find the minimum or maximum value of a function $q(t)$, we find its derivative $dq/dt$ and set it to zero. The value of $t$ obtained will correspond to a minimum or maximum.
*   **Current (I) from Charge (q):** $I = \frac{dq}{dt}$. This means current is the derivative of charge with respect to time.
*   **Force (F) from Momentum (p):** $F = \frac{dp}{dt}$. This means force is the derivative of momentum with respect to time.

**Trick/Method (from video explanation):**

The video's "trick" here isn't a shortcut formula for differentiation itself, but a rapid way to solve application problems involving finding minimums or related rates from multiple-choice options.

**For finding minimum/maximum value (like minimum charge):**

1.  **Identify the function:** Get the function whose minimum/maximum is needed, e.g., $q(t)$.
2.  **Take the derivative:** Find the derivative of the function, e.g., $dq/dt$.
3.  **Set derivative to zero:** Set the derivative equal to zero and solve for the variable, e.g., $t$.
4.  **Test options (for efficiency in MCQ):** For multiple-choice questions, apply the multiple-choice options to the derivative $dq/dt$. The option that makes $dq/dt = 0$ is the correct answer.

**For finding force (F) from momentum (p) (also a derivative application):**

1.  **Identify the function:** Get the momentum function, $p(t)$.
2.  **Take the derivative:** Find the derivative of momentum, $dp/dt$, which is the Force, $F$.
3.  **Substitute time value:** Substitute the given time value (e.g., $t=2s$) into the derived force function.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1 (Minimum Charge):**
    *   Problem: The current in a circuit is defined as $I = \frac{dq}{dt}$. The charge (q) flowing through a circuit, as a function of time (t), is given by $q = 5t^2 - 20t + 3$. The minimum charge flows through the circuit at:
        a. t = 4s
        b. t = 2s
        c. t = 6s
        d. t = 3s
    *   Steps:
        1.  The charge function is $q = 5t^2 - 20t + 3$.
        2.  The derivative $dq/dt = 10t - 20$.
        3.  For minimum charge, $dq/dt = 0$, so $10t - 20 = 0 \implies t = 2$.
        4.  Testing $t=2$s in the derivative: $10(2)-20 = 20-20=0$.
    *   **Result:** b. t = 2s

*   **Example 2 (Force from Momentum):**
    *   Problem: The momentum of a body moving in a straight line is $p = (t^2 + 2t + 1)$ kg m/s. Force acting on the body at $t=2$ sec will be: (Given: $F = \frac{dp}{dt}$)
        a. 6 N
        b. 8 N
        c. 4 N
        d. 2 N
    *   Steps:
        1.  The momentum function is $p = t^2 + 2t + 1$.
        2.  Force $F = \frac{dp}{dt}$. Derivative of $p(t)$ is $F = 2t + 2$.
        3.  Substitute $t=2$ sec into the force equation: $F = 2(2) + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6$.
    *   **Result:** a. 6 N
## Integration Trick 1
This trick provides a shortcut for integrating functions of the form:
$$ \int \frac{1}{(n + a)(n + b)} \, dn $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the constants:** In the given integral, identify the two constant values being added to 'n' (or 'x') in the denominator. Let's call them 'a' and 'b'.
    *   Example 1: $$ \int \frac{1}{(n + 10)(n + 15)} \, dn $$
        *   Constants are $a=10$ and $b=15$.
    *   Example 2: $$ \int \frac{1}{(n + 4)(n + 8)} \, dn $$
        *   Constants are $a=4$ and $b=8$.
    *   Example 3: $$ \int \frac{1}{(n + 7)(n + 6)} \, dn $$
        *   Constants are $a=7$ and $b=6$.

2.  **Calculate the difference:** Find the absolute difference between the two constants, $|b - a|$.
    *   Example 1: $|15 - 10| = 5$
    *   Example 2: $|8 - 4| = 4$
    *   Example 3: $|7 - 6| = 1$

3.  **Form the coefficient:** The coefficient of the result will be 1 divided by this difference.
    *   Example 1: $\frac{1}{5}$
    *   Example 2: $\frac{1}{4}$
    *   Example 3: $\frac{1}{1}$ (which is 1)

4.  **Apply the logarithm:** Multiply the coefficient by "log" (natural logarithm).

5.  **Form the logarithmic argument:** Inside the logarithm, create a fraction where the numerator is the term with the *smaller* constant, and the denominator is the term with the *larger* constant.
    *   Example 1: $\frac{n + 10}{n + 15}$
    *   Example 2: $\frac{n + 4}{n + 8}$
    *   Example 3: $\frac{n + 6}{n + 7}$

6.  **Add the constant of integration:** Finally, add $+ C$ for the constant of integration.

**General Formula:**

$$ \int \frac{1}{(n + a)(n + b)} \, dn = \frac{1}{|b - a|} \log\left(\left|\frac{n + \min(a,b)}{n + \max(a,b)}\right|\right) + C $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{1}{(n + 10)(n + 15)} \, dn $$
    *   Difference: $15 - 10 = 5$
    *   Smaller constant term: $(n + 10)$
    *   Larger constant term: $(n + 15)$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{5} \log\left(\left|\frac{n + 10}{n + 15}\right|\right) + C $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{1}{(n + 4)(n + 8)} \, dn $$
    *   Difference: $8 - 4 = 4$
    *   Smaller constant term: $(n + 4)$
    *   Larger constant term: $(n + 8)$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{4} \log\left(\left|\frac{n + 4}{n + 8}\right|\right) + C $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{1}{(n + 7)(n + 6)} \, dn $$
    *   Difference: $7 - 6 = 1$
    *   Smaller constant term: $(n + 6)$
    *   Larger constant term: $(n + 7)$
    *   **Result:** $$ 1 \cdot \log\left(\left|\frac{n + 6}{n + 7}\right|\right) + C \quad \text{or simply} \quad \log\left(\left|\frac{n + 6}{n + 7}\right|\right) + C $$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is applicable for integrals with two distinct linear factors in the denominator.
*   It simplifies the process of partial fraction decomposition for this specific form.
*   The variable 'n' in the examples can be replaced with 'x' or any other variable.
*   Remember to always add the constant of integration $+ C$.



## Integration Trick 2

This trick provides a shortcut for integrating functions of the form:
$$ \int \frac{dx}{(x + a)(x + b)} $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the constants:** In the given integral, identify the two constant values being added to 'x' in the denominator. Let's call them 'a' and 'b'.
    *   Example: For the problem $\int \frac{dx}{(x + 3)(x + 2)}$, the constants are $a=3$ and $b=2$.

2.  **Calculate the difference:** Find the difference between 'a' and 'b', which is $(a - b)$. Note that in this specific formula, the order matters ($a-b$ not $|a-b|$).
    *   Example 1: $3 - 2 = 1$
    *   Example 2: $4 - 1 = 3$
    *   Example 3: $7 - 3 = 4$

3.  **Form the coefficient:** The coefficient of the result will be 1 divided by this difference, $\frac{1}{a-b}$.
    *   Example 1: $\frac{1}{1}$
    *   Example 2: $\frac{1}{3}$
    *   Example 3: $\frac{1}{4}$

4.  **Apply the logarithm:** Multiply the coefficient by "log" (natural logarithm).

5.  **Form the logarithmic argument:** Inside the logarithm, create a fraction where the numerator is the term $(x+b)$ and the denominator is the term $(x+a)$.
    *   Example 1: $\frac{x+2}{x+3}$
    *   Example 2: $\frac{x+1}{x+4}$
    *   Example 3: $\frac{x+3}{x+7}$

6.  **Add the constant of integration:** Finally, add $+ C$ for the constant of integration.

**General Formula:**

$$ \int \frac{dx}{(x + a)(x + b)} = \frac{1}{a - b} \log\left(\left|\frac{x + b}{x + a}\right|\right) + C $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{dx}{(x + 3)(x + 2)} $$
    *   Constants: $a=3$, $b=2$
    *   Difference: $a-b = 3 - 2 = 1$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{1} \log\left(\left|\frac{x + 2}{x + 3}\right|\right) + C $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{dx}{(x + 4)(x + 1)} $$
    *   Constants: $a=4$, $b=1$
    *   Difference: $a-b = 4 - 1 = 3$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{3} \log\left(\left|\frac{x + 1}{x + 4}\right|\right) + C $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{dx}{(x + 7)(x + 3)} $$
    *   Constants: $a=7$, $b=3$
    *   Difference: $a-b = 7 - 3 = 4$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{4} \log\left(\left|\frac{x + 3}{x + 7}\right|\right) + C $$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick is applicable for integrals with two distinct linear factors in the denominator.
*   It provides a quick way to solve these types of integrals without explicitly performing partial fraction decomposition.
*   The variable used for integration (e.g., 'x') is consistent throughout the formula.
*   Remember to always add the constant of integration $+ C$.

## Integration Trick 3

This trick provides a shortcut for integrating functions of the form:
$$ \int \frac{dx}{\cos(x+a)\sin(x+b)} $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify the constants:** In the given integral, identify the two constants, 'a' and 'b', from the cosine and sine terms in the denominator.
    *   Example 1: For `∫ dx / (cos(x+15)sin(x+30))`, we have $a=15$ and $b=30$.
    *   Example 2: For `∫ dx / (cos(x+45)sin(x+60))`, we have $a=45$ and $b=60$.

2.  **Calculate the coefficient:** The coefficient of the result is `1 / cos(a-b)`. Note that since cosine is an even function, `cos(a-b)` is the same as `cos(b-a)`.
    *   Example 1: `1 / cos(15-30) = 1 / cos(-15) = 1 / cos(15°)`.
    *   Example 2: `1 / cos(45-60) = 1 / cos(-15) = 1 / cos(15°)`.

3.  **Apply the logarithm:** Multiply the coefficient by "log" (natural logarithm).

4.  **Form the logarithmic argument:** Inside the logarithm, create a fraction where the numerator is the sine term from the original integral, and the denominator is the cosine term.
    *   Example 1: `sin(x+30) / cos(x+15)`
    *   Example 2: `sin(x+60) / cos(x+45)`

5.  **Add the constant of integration:** Finally, add `+ C`.

**General Formula:**

$$ \int \frac{dx}{\cos(x+a)\sin(x+b)} = \frac{1}{\cos(a-b)} \log\left|\frac{\sin(x+b)}{\cos(x+a)}\right| + C $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{dx}{\cos(x+15)\sin(x+30)} $$
    *   Constants: $a=15$, $b=30$
    *   Difference: $30 - 15 = 15$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{\cos(15^\circ)} \log\left|\frac{\sin(x+30)}{\cos(x+15)}\right| + C $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{dx}{\cos(x+45)\sin(x+60)} $$
    *   Constants: $a=45$, $b=60$
    *   Difference: $60 - 45 = 15$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{\cos(15^\circ)} \log\left|\frac{\sin(x+60)}{\cos(x+45)}\right| + C $$

**Key Points:**

*   This trick applies specifically to the form `1 / (cos * sin)`.
*   The argument of the logarithm is always `(sine term / cosine term)`.
*   The coefficient is `1 / cos(difference of angles)`.

## Integration Trick 4

This trick provides a shortcut for definite integrals of the form:
$$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{dx}{a^2\cos^2x + b^2\sin^2x} $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Check the form:** Ensure the integral has the limits from 0 to π and the denominator is in the form `a²cos²x + b²sin²x`.
2.  **Identify a and b:** Find the values of 'a' and 'b' by taking the square root of the coefficients of `cos²x` and `sin²x`, respectively.
    *   Example 1: For `8cos²x + 7sin²x`, $a²=8 \implies a=\sqrt{8}$ and $b²=7 \implies b=\sqrt{7}$.
    *   Example 2: For `25cos²x + 9sin²x`, $a²=25 \implies a=5$ and $b²=9 \implies b=3$.
3.  **Apply the formula:** The result is directly calculated using the formula `π / (2ab)`.

**General Formula:**

$$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{dx}{a^2\cos^2x + b^2\sin^2x} = \frac{\pi}{2ab} $$

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{dx}{8\cos^2x + 7\sin^2x} $$
    *   Constants: $a = \sqrt{8}$, $b = \sqrt{7}$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{\pi}{2(\sqrt{8})(\sqrt{7})} = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{56}} $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{dx}{25\cos^2x + 9\sin^2x} $$
    *   Constants: $a = \sqrt{25} = 5$, $b = \sqrt{9} = 3$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{\pi}{2(5)(3)} = \frac{\pi}{30} $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{dx}{16\cos^2x + 4\sin^2x} $$
    *   Constants: $a = \sqrt{16} = 4$, $b = \sqrt{4} = 2$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{\pi}{2(4)(2)} = \frac{\pi}{16} $$

**Key Points:**
* This trick is valid only for definite integrals with limits from 0 to π.
* The coefficients `a²` and `b²` must be positive.
* Be careful to take the square root of the coefficients to find `a` and `b`.

## Integration Trick 5

This trick provides a shortcut for integrating functions of the form:
$$ \int \frac{ax+b}{cx+d} \,dx $$

**General Formula (as presented in the video):**

$$ \int \left(\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\right) dx = \frac{ax}{c} - \frac{(ad+bc)}{c^2} \log|\text{Denominator}| + C $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify coefficients:** Identify the coefficients `a, b, c, d` from the linear expressions.
2.  **First Term:** The first term of the answer is `ax / c`.
3.  **Second Term Coefficient:** Calculate the value `(ad + bc)`. Divide this by `c²`. The second term's full coefficient is `- (ad+bc) / c²`.
4.  **Logarithm Term:** Multiply the second term's coefficient by `log|Denominator|`, which is `log|cx+d|`.
5.  **Add Constant of Integration:** Add `+ C`.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \left(\frac{3x+2}{2x+5}\right) dx $$
    *   Coefficients: $a=3, b=2, c=2, d=5$
    *   First Term: `3x / 2`
    *   Second Term Coefficient: $ad+bc = (3)(5) + (2)(2) = 15 + 4 = 19$. `c² = 2² = 4`. So the coefficient is `-19/4`.
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{3x}{2} - \frac{19}{4} \log|2x+5| + C $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \left(\frac{8x+13}{3x+7}\right) dx $$
    *   Coefficients: $a=8, b=13, c=3, d=7$
    *   First Term: `8x / 3`
    *   Second Term Coefficient: $ad+bc = (8)(7) + (13)(3) = 56 + 39 = 95$. `c² = 3² = 9`. So the coefficient is `-95/9`.
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{8x}{3} - \frac{95}{9} \log|3x+7| + C $$

## Integration Trick 6

This section covers two related shortcut formulas for definite integrals involving square roots of quadratic expressions.

### Form 1: Denominator

**Formula:**
$$ \int_{a}^{b} \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x-a)(b-x)}} \,dx = \pi $$
**How it works:**
If an integral has limits from `a` to `b` and the integrand is `1` divided by the square root of `(x-a)(b-x)`, the answer is always `π`.

*   **Example from the video:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int_{4}^{6} \frac{1}{\sqrt{(x-4)(6-x)}} \,dx $$
    *   Identify: The form matches with $a=4$ and $b=6$.
    *   **Result:** $$ \pi $$

### Form 2: Numerator

**Formula:**
$$ \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{(x-a)(b-x)} \,dx = \frac{\pi}{8}(b-a)^2 $$
**How it works:**
If an integral has limits from `a` to `b` and the integrand is the square root of `(x-a)(b-x)`, the answer is calculated by `(π/8) * (b-a)²`.

*   **Example from the video:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int_{12}^{26} \sqrt{(x-12)(26-x)} \,dx $$
    *   Identify: The form matches with $a=12$ and $b=26$.
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{\pi}{8}(26-12)^2 = \frac{\pi}{8}(14)^2 = \frac{196\pi}{8} $$

**Key Points:**
*   These tricks only work when the limits of integration (`a` and `b`) directly correspond to the constants in the terms `(x-a)` and `(b-x)`.
*   The result depends entirely on whether the square root term is in the numerator or the denominator.

## Integration Trick 7

This trick provides a shortcut for integrating functions of the form:
$$ \int \frac{1}{ax^2+bx+c} \,dx $$

**General Formula:**
$$ \int \frac{1}{ax^2+bx+c} \,dx = \frac{2}{\sqrt{4ac-b^2}} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{(ax^2+bx+c)'}{\sqrt{4ac-b^2}}\right) + C $$
Where `(ax² + bx + c)'` denotes the derivative of the quadratic expression, which is `2ax + b`.

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify coefficients:** Identify `a, b, c` from the quadratic in the denominator.
2.  **Calculate the Discriminant Term:** Compute the value `D = 4ac - b²`.
3.  **Form the Coefficient:** The coefficient outside the `tan⁻¹` is `2 / √D`.
4.  **Find the Derivative:** Find the derivative of the quadratic, which is `2ax + b`.
5.  **Assemble the `tan⁻¹` term:** The final term is `tan⁻¹((Derivative) / √D)`.
6.  **Combine and add constant:** Combine all parts and add `+ C`.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{1}{x^2+3x+7} \,dx $$
    *   Coefficients: $a=1, b=3, c=7$
    *   Discriminant Term: $4ac - b^2 = 4(1)(7) - 3^2 = 28 - 9 = 19$.
    *   Derivative: `2(1)x + 3 = 2x + 3`.
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{2}{\sqrt{19}} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2x+3}{\sqrt{19}}\right) + C $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{1}{5x^2+6x+5} \,dx $$
    *   Coefficients: $a=5, b=6, c=5$
    *   Discriminant Term: $4ac - b^2 = 4(5)(5) - 6^2 = 100 - 36 = 64$. So, `√64 = 8`.
    *   Derivative: `2(5)x + 6 = 10x + 6`.
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{2}{8} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{10x+6}{8}\right) + C = \frac{1}{4} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{10x+6}{8}\right) + C $$

## Integration Trick 8

This section covers two related shortcut formulas for integrating the product of an exponential function and a trigonometric function.

### Form 1: Sine

**Formula:**
$$ \int e^{mx} \sin(nx) \,dx = \frac{e^{mx}}{m^2 + n^2} (m\sin(nx) - n\cos(nx)) + c $$

### Form 2: Cosine

**Formula:**
$$ \int e^{mx} \cos(nx) \,dx = \frac{e^{mx}}{m^2 + n^2} (m\cos(nx) + n\sin(nx)) + c $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify m and n:** `m` is the coefficient of `x` in the exponent, and `n` is the coefficient of `x` inside the trigonometric function.
2.  **Form the Common Factor:** The term `e^(mx) / (m² + n²) ` is common to both formulas.
3.  **Form the Bracket Term:**
    *   **For `sin(nx)`:** The term is `m(original function) - n(derivative of original function)`. So, `m sin(nx) - n cos(nx)`.
    *   **For `cos(nx)`:** The term is `m(original function) + n(integral of original function)`. So, `m cos(nx) + n sin(nx)`.
4.  **Combine and add constant:** Combine the parts and add `+ C`.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1 (Sine):**
    *   Problem: $$ \int e^{2x} \sin(3x) \,dx $$
    *   Coefficients: $m=2, n=3$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{e^{2x}}{2^2 + 3^2} (2\sin(3x) - 3\cos(3x)) + c = \frac{e^{2x}}{13} (2\sin(3x) - 3\cos(3x)) + c $$

*   **Example 2 (Sine):**
    *   Problem: $$ \int e^{2x} \sin(5x) \,dx $$
    *   Coefficients: $m=2, n=5$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{e^{2x}}{2^2 + 5^2} (2\sin(5x) - 5\cos(5x)) + c = \frac{e^{2x}}{29} (2\sin(5x) - 5\cos(5x)) + c $$

*   **Example 3 (Cosine):**
    *   Problem: $$ \int e^{5x} \cos(3x) \,dx $$
    *   Coefficients: $m=5, n=3$
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{e^{5x}}{5^2 + 3^2} (5\cos(3x) + 3\sin(3x)) + c = \frac{e^{5x}}{34} (5\cos(3x) + 3\sin(3x)) + c $$

## Integration Trick 9

This trick applies to the definite integral of `sin(ax)cos(bx)` from 0 to π. The result depends on the parity (even or odd) of the difference between the coefficients `a` and `b`.

**Form:**
$$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(ax)\cos(bx) \,dx $$

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify coefficients:** Identify `a` from `sin(ax)` and `b` from `cos(bx)`.
2.  **Calculate the difference:** Find the difference `a - b` (or `b - a`).
3.  **Check parity:** Determine if the difference is an even or odd integer.
    *   **If (a - b) is even:** The value of the integral is **0**.
    *   **If (a - b) is odd:** The value of the integral is given by the formula **`2a / (a² - b²)`**.

**Examples from the video (with solutions):**

*   **Example 1:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(3x)\cos(7x) \,dx $$
    *   Coefficients: $a=3, b=7$
    *   Difference: $3 - 7 = -4$ (Even)
    *   **Result:** $$ 0 $$

*   **Example 2:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(70x)\cos(20x) \,dx $$
    *   Coefficients: $a=70, b=20$
    *   Difference: $70 - 20 = 50$ (Even)
    *   **Result:** $$ 0 $$

*   **Example 3:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(40x)\cos(15x) \,dx $$
    *   Coefficients: $a=40, b=15$
    *   Difference: $40 - 15 = 25$ (Odd)
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{2a}{a^2 - b^2} = \frac{2(40)}{40^2 - 15^2} = \frac{80}{1600 - 225} = \frac{80}{1375} $$

**Key Points:**
*   This trick is only for the definite integral from 0 to π.
*   The function must be in the `sin(ax)cos(bx)` form.
*   The result is determined by checking if `a-b` is even or odd.

## Integration Trick 10

This section covers two related shortcut formulas for integrating functions of the form `1 / (a + b cos²x)` and `1 / (a + b sin²x)`.

### Form 1: Cosine Squared

**Formula:**
$$ \int \frac{1}{a + b\cos^2x} \,dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a(a+b)}} \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{a}{a+b}}\tan x\right) + C $$
_Note: The video presents this in a slightly different but equivalent form: `(1/a) * √(a/(a+b)) * tan⁻¹(...)`_

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify constants:** Identify `a` (the standalone constant) and `b` (the coefficient of `cos²x`).
2.  **Calculate the terms:**
    *   The main coefficient is `1 / √(a(a+b))`.
    *   The term inside the `tan⁻¹` and multiplying `tan x` is `√(a / (a+b))`.
3.  **Assemble the answer:** Combine the parts as shown in the formula.

*   **Example from the video:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{1}{7 + 3\cos^2x} \,dx $$
    *   Constants: $a=7, b=3$
    *   `a+b = 10`
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{7(10)}} \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{7}{10}}\tan x\right) + C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{70}} \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{7}{10}}\tan x\right) + C $$

### Form 2: Sine Squared

**Formula:**
$$ \int \frac{1}{a + b\sin^2x} \,dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a(a+b)}} \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{a+b}{a}}\tan x\right) + C $$
_Note: The video presents this as: `(1/(a+b)) * √((a+b)/a) * tan⁻¹(...)`_

**How it works:**

1.  **Identify constants:** Identify `a` (the standalone constant) and `b` (the coefficient of `sin²x`).
2.  **Calculate the terms:**
    *   The main coefficient is `1 / √(a(a+b))`.
    *   The term inside the `tan⁻¹` and multiplying `tan x` is `√((a+b) / a)`.
3.  **Assemble the answer:** Combine the parts as shown in the formula.

*   **Example from the video:**
    *   Problem: $$ \int \frac{1}{6 + 8\sin^2x} \,dx $$
    *   Constants: $a=6, b=8$
    *   `a+b = 14`
    *   **Result:** $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6(14)}} \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{14}{6}}\tan x\right) + C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{84}} \tan^{-1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{7}{3}}\tan x\right) + C $$

**Key Points:**
*   The only difference between the `cos²x` and `sin²x` formulas is the fraction inside the square root within the `tan⁻¹` term.
*   For `cos²x`: it is `√(a / (a+b))`.
*   For `sin²x`: it is `√((a+b) / a)`.
